2022-09-25 15:36:36+00:00,"4/ Essentially, the new right wants to roll back American social progress 100 years. Women should know their place (behind men), and ""multiculturalism"" is corrosive. America needs a dominant culture, says the new right, and it should be white and patriarchal."

2022-09-19 13:56:30+00:00,4/ What I found in my meetings is a view of innovation and increased connectivity as a near universal net good. Feels like a bit of a innovation hamster wheel. Not enough leaders seriously asking - does the innovation actually increase citizens' happiness?
2022-09-19 13:56:29+00:00,"3/ But for many, tech now overwhelms and vexes us, addicting our children to screens, funneling users into information silos, elevating the most extreme voices, and consolidating power and wealth into the select expert elites who know how manipulate the technology."

And that mandated call to local police could have set that process in motion."
2022-06-29 20:52:46+00:00,"5/ Or maybe the wait would have allowed his moment of crisis to pass. Or maybe if the gun store had told Ramos that as a condition of buying these guns, a call was going to be made to the local police department, it might have scared him straight."
2022-06-29 20:52:46+00:00,"4/ They would have had time to intervene bc the new law creates a de facto waiting period, of anywhere from 3-10 days, before an 18-20 yr old can buy a gun. 

Also, the waiting period could have prevented Ramos from getting the guns at all before the last day of school."
2022-06-29 20:52:45+00:00,3/ The police likely knew Ramos was dangerous. That call would have given them key information that a kid in crisis was rushing out to buy guns the minute he turned 18. The police could have taken steps to intervene.
2022-06-29 20:52:45+00:00,"2/ Most importantly, the bill requires that no gun can be sold to an 18 year old without a call being placed by the FBI to the local police to check on the status of the buyer.

Reporting suggests Ramos was known to the local police - they had been to his house multiple times."
2022-06-29 20:52:45+00:00,"I’ve read a few articles on the gun safety bill that suggest there isn’t anything in it that could have prevented the Uvalde shooting.

1/ Let me explain:"

2022-01-10 23:35:20+00:00,5/ Passing the bill would also reward Republicans' year long blockade of State Department nominees and encourage more hostage taking. That's terrible for the U.S. Senate and U.S. security and and extra reason for the Senate to reject the bill this week.

The Cruz bill sanctions can't stop the gas from flowing. But Germany can. So why break with Germany now?"
2022-01-10 23:35:19+00:00,"3/ The impact of the Cruz bill would be to divide the U.S. from Germany right at the moment we need Germany to be leading the readying of U.S./Europe sanctions on Russia that will deter them from invading Ukraine.

2022-01-10 23:35:18+00:00,"2/ The new German government has taken a new position on the pipeline. They have stopped it indefinitely, so why on earth would we pass a stale bill that applies sanctions on Germany for a policy they no longer hold? Makes no sense."

https://t.co/6yjqCDpczh"
2021-11-04 15:03:13+00:00,"5/ So this idea that the 2nd Amendment prohibits these laws is a completely modern fabrication. 

The people who wrote and approved the Bill of Rights were often the same who supported laws controlling the public carrying of weapons. That's the truth."
2021-11-04 15:03:12+00:00,"4/ As an example, Alabama's 1837 law was entitled ""An act to suppress the evil practice of carrying weapons secretly.”

Early America was full of laws allowing government to regulate guns in public. It was viewed as a perfectly constitutional exercise of government authority."
2021-11-04 15:03:12+00:00,"3/ And it's not like independence from Britain - or the adoption of the 2nd Amendment - changed anything. In the late 1700s, North Carolina and Virginia passed laws restricting carrying guns in public. In the 1800s, 38 more states joined the list."
2021-11-04 15:03:11+00:00,"2/ Colonial America was full of laws regulating who could carry guns in America. 

As early as 1686, New Jersey enacted a law against wearing weapons because they induced “great Fear and Quarrels.” Massachusetts followed in 1750."
2021-11-04 15:03:11+00:00,"1/ The idea that the Constitution doesn't allow government to control the carrying of guns in public would have been MYSTIFYING to our founding fathers.

2021-08-19 22:04:19+00:00,There’s a pretty amazing amount of this going on right now re Afghanistan. Many pundits and writers have decided their narrative in advance and are molding Biden’s words to fit.
2021-08-19 20:13:07+00:00,"a. Biden didn’t say he was not presented with a 2,500 option. He said he received split advice. 

b. This story reports that one option was to “negotiate” w the Taliban so that we could keep 2500. That’s different than “keep 2500”."

2021-08-19 14:42:14+00:00,Of course he did. Every Secretary of Defense knew what the intel said - that our training mission had failed and the Afghan military would fall to the Taliban once we left - and just pushed the problem onto the next Defense Secretary.
2021-08-17 20:41:10+00:00,"The idea that a small, cloistered U.S. presence in Afghanistan was going to be able to prevent the completely understandable public panic caused by the overnight, complete collapse of the Afghan military is probably without merit."
2021-08-17 20:20:54+00:00,"Not sure what this means. Biden ran on a promise to exit Afghanistan. His decision to leave came as no surprise. Also, America never made a commitment to our NATO allies to stay forever. In fact, many of our NATO partners pulled their troops out of Afghanistan long ago."
2021-08-17 20:11:18+00:00,Everybody has a plan that works perfectly on paper in Afghanistan.
2021-08-17 20:00:27+00:00,"Magical thinking is often the MO of the military/foreign policy establishment in Washington, but the idea the 2020 state of affairs (2,500 troops, Taliban withholding attacks on provincial capitals) would continue past this summer takes the cake."
2021-08-17 02:33:53+00:00,"7/ This is all to say that there is no way to know right now whether the terrorist threat from Afghanistan will grow or not. It COULD, but no one knows if it WILL. And anyone today who says they know for certain isn't telling the truth."
2021-08-17 02:33:53+00:00,"6/ So now the U.S. must put in place monitoring and counter-terrorism capabilities to track and target Al Qaeda activity in the region. 

FWIW Al Qaeda affiliates in Yemen and Africa are much stronger than Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and we keep them at bay without ground troops."
2021-08-17 02:33:52+00:00,"5/ Of course there are lots of reasons to believe the Taliban will ignore that agreement. There are elements of the Taliban that are still allied with Al Qaeda.

But there are also good reasons why the Taliban would decide it isn't worth the trouble to let Al Qaeda reconstitute."
2021-08-17 02:33:52+00:00,"4/ Then the Taliban signed an agreement with the Trump Administration agreeing to refuse safe harbor to Al Qaeda if the Taliban came back into power. That's a big part of the reason the Trump Admin agreed to draw down to 2,500."
2021-08-17 02:33:52+00:00,"3/ And remember, for years the Taliban has been in control of over half of Afghanistan. So if the Taliban wanted to give Al Qaeda a safe haven, Al Qaeda would have had plenty of room to operate. The Taliban made a strategic decision to keep Al Qaeda at bay."
2021-08-17 02:33:51+00:00,"2/ Twenty years of American presence in Afghanistan smashed Al Qaeda in Afghanistan to pieces. It's likely only 100-200 members remain, and they do not possess the ability to plan and execute an attack against the United States."

2021-08-16 01:57:03+00:00,"I'm open the possibility there was a different way to withdraw that wouldn't have led to a quick Taliban victory.

2021-08-15 18:24:07+00:00,"On the call with @SecBlinken and @SecDef this morning I confirmed that had Biden decided to abandon the agreement negotiated by President Trump, the U.S. would have had to surge thousands of additional troops into Afghanistan.

2021-08-14 17:50:02+00:00,"For those of you who think Biden was wrong and instead we should have surged back to 10,000 troops in Afghanistan and restarted the war against the Taliban, consider this 👇"
2021-08-14 03:19:36+00:00,"Biden is just executing Trump's Afghanistan policy. The reason the establishment didn't bark then or now is that they have no better ideas. All they can offer is ""stay longer and cross fingers""."

""Poppy"", he said, without hesitation."
2021-08-13 15:44:33+00:00,"4/ The elders told us how the Taliban used to come into town and steal their crops. Now, with U.S. Army protection, the farmers could harvest in peace and sell their crops at market prices. The Taliban were still their customers, but at least now they got paid, thanks to the U.S."
2021-08-13 15:44:32+00:00,"3/ We were greeted by the Army unit stationed there. Their leader was an impressive guy from Goshen, CT. These guys were bad ass, and rightly proud of having run the Taliban out of town.

2021-02-11 01:20:17+00:00,I wanted to take a moment to share some thoughts after day two of the impeachment trial. https://t.co/yXn3CTOOcC
2021-02-10 14:24:40+00:00,Joe Biden ran on the idea that he could pursue an agenda that would be broadly popular and make a difference in people's lives. He's doing it.
2021-02-10 14:22:25+00:00,"Trump's lawyers are very very bad. 

But remember, that's because Trump's case is very very bad and no good lawyers were willing to argue it."
2021-02-10 04:16:06+00:00,"I have a feeling Trump's 6pm tweet from January 6th (""Remember this day forever!"") is going to show up over and over again in this trial (the managers brought it up twice today). It's essentially an admission of guilt."
2021-02-10 04:09:49+00:00,It just strikes me as so dangerous for the Senate to voluntarily give up its prerogative to hold a President or any other high official accountable for actions taken during the transition of power. That's the moment when the highest degree of accountability is necessary.
2021-02-09 16:43:56+00:00,"This is why we need to pass a relief bill immediately. Once again, the economy is working fine for the high income folks and tanking for everyone else."
2021-02-09 15:38:36+00:00,I was basically raised on Vito’s Pizza in Wethersfield. So good.

2021-02-09 13:12:15+00:00,"If the House managers want witnesses, the Senate should allow it.  If they don’t want witnesses, that’s their choice. 

They make the case. We deliver the verdict."

2021-01-29 20:50:23+00:00,"Video from my visit this morning to @BackusHospital to get a briefing on their vaccine distribution program. Bottom line: they need more vaccine and more staff to do vaccinations. 

Biden’s COVID relief package delivers on both counts."
2021-01-29 15:13:02+00:00,Republicans are VERY MAD we are holding an impeachment trial because they want to move more quickly to consider a COVID relief bill that they plan to vote against.
2021-01-29 15:09:58+00:00,It’s priceless to listen to Senate Republicans complain about spending a week on accountability for the January 6th attack. They sat on their hands for 9 months last year refusing to pass a COVID relief bill until Democrats dragged them to the table in December.
