2021-01-28 22:36:05+00:00,"Let's also note what the consumer welfare standard is NOT: it is not a narrow concern with price. As Judge Bork wrote, it encompasses “innovation, choice among differing products"" and quality. That more than covers the ways in which markets like Big Tech are failing us. 3/5"
2021-01-28 22:36:04+00:00,"What is the consumer welfare standard? It's a guardrail that ensures 1) the primary beneficiaries of the antitrust laws are the people, not big business; and 2) that unelected judges are not allowed to use antitrust to advance their own political preferences. 2/5"
2021-01-28 22:36:04+00:00,"There’s a lot of talk about antitrust legislation this Congress. One thing lost in many proposed reforms: the consumer welfare standard is not a get-out-of-jail-free card for Big Tech. We don’t need to change the law, we need to enforce it. 1/5"

2021-01-26 14:56:20+00:00,Good to see the Biden administration admit their oil/gas moratorium is bad for local economies. Unfortunately they are only exempting Native American lands from their job killing executive order. The rest of America should get this exemption too. https://t.co/b56c5tEgec

2021-01-25 21:11:19+00:00,The Biden Administration’s pause on RS 2477 right-of-way adjudication tramples on the rights of the public to access public lands. Witnesses for these cases are becoming harder to find. Urban Dems are again restricting how rural Americans can use our land! https://t.co/4Ysarwm8cQ
2021-01-25 20:37:07+00:00,Great talking to @gabby_hoffman about the need for Antiquities Act reform. Public land management decisions should be made by those closest to the land. https://t.co/GxHcHdzBB4
2021-01-22 19:12:11+00:00,I have been told there was a miscommunication between law enforcement agencies yesterday about where Guardsmen were permitted to be. That miscommunication has been resolved and plenty of indoor space has now been made available to the Guardsmen.

2021-01-21 21:27:49+00:00,Great talking to @LeeLons today about President Biden’s Bears Ears EO. This expanded use of the Antiquities Act is simply incompatible with his promise of unity.
