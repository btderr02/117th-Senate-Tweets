2022-08-16 20:05:56+00:00,"2) If these records include classified, national security matters, why did the Attorney General wait a year and a half after POTUS 45 left office to secure them?"
2022-08-16 20:05:56+00:00,"Some obvious questions: 

1) why did the Attorney General seek to unseal only part of the search warrant, withholding the affidavit that purportedly established probable cause for the search?"
2022-08-16 20:05:55+00:00,We still don’t have all the facts to decide who is right and who is wrong on the merits of Garland’s search warrant of POTUS 45’s home.
