2022-08-16 20:02:10+00:00,"Democrats robbed Americans last year by spending our economy into record inflation. This year, their solution is to do it a second time. The partisan bill President Biden signed into law today means higher taxes, higher energy bills, and aggressive IRS audits."

2022-04-27 22:22:40+00:00,"While the far left has been waging a national anti-police, anti-law-enforcement campaign, violent crime has soared from coast to coast. Cities are under siege.  Until federal, state, and local Democrats get with the program, innocent people will continue to suffer."
2022-04-27 14:10:27+00:00,The Biden Administration’s approach to the border is failing America. They are stumbling through this core governing duty with no plan and backward priorities. Democrats would rather appease radicals with functional open borders than conduct the bare minimum in enforcement.

2022-04-13 23:02:42+00:00,Democrats are ending the COVID emergency for illegal immigrants but extending it for American citizens. This White House is using the pandemic as a pretext to shamelessly pick and choose liberal policies to advance. Completely unacceptable. My full statement: https://t.co/p9chA2jj2x
2022-04-12 19:23:06+00:00,"The Biden economy continues to set new terrible records. Inflation just hit its fastest pace in more than 40 years. Food, gas, and housing costs are crushing families. Prices are soaring way faster than workers’ pay growth."
2022-04-10 19:42:16+00:00,The Biden Administration needs to take the shackles off of domestic energy production. World events remind us how important American oil and natural gas production is for our national security and our partners. We can meet our needs and help the Europeans wean off Russian energy. https://t.co/CieX2aRXn7
2022-04-08 17:04:41+00:00,Putin is not going to be deterred just by being called a war criminal. He will be deterred on the battlefield.

2022-04-06 16:12:12+00:00,"Judge Jackson’s record and testimony suggest exactly the kind of liberal activist that President Biden promised he’d nominate. In case after case, she twisted the law or ignored guidelines to arrive at the policy outcome she wanted. And that outcome was often going soft on crime."
2022-03-31 18:18:35+00:00,The worst inflation in 40 years is fleecing American consumers from the gas pump to the grocery store. Democrats’ policies have prices rising faster than wages. The American people know one month of war in Europe doesn't explain 12 months of rising inflation on Democrats' watch.
2022-03-30 15:18:33+00:00,"I have total confidence in Justice Thomas’s impartiality in every aspect of the work of the Court. 
 
Each of the nine justices should feel free to make every single judicial decision they make with total independence and complete freedom."
2022-03-30 15:18:26+00:00,"Judicial independence is essential to our Republic and integral to the rule of law. The far left’s latest attack, a clumsy and baseless attempt to nullify Justice Thomas’s presence on the Court, is beyond the pale."
2022-03-29 19:31:28+00:00,"Democrats’ massive inflation is hammering working families. It’s badly hurt our entire economy.

But President Biden just proposed a new budget that would dramatically increase liberal spending and slap the biggest tax hikes on American history on top.

They just do not get it."
2022-03-28 21:51:10+00:00,"President Biden's budget reinforces the disconnect between this Administration’s far-left goals and what Americans need. It’s soft on the defense funding we need to outpace Russia and China, heavy on left-wing waste and historic tax hikes."
2022-03-24 20:28:37+00:00,"I went into the Senate’s consideration of Judge Jackson’s nomination with an open mind.

2022-03-23 17:26:10+00:00,"Judge Jackson tried to deflect on key questions by telling Senators that constitutional issues haven’t come up often during her judicial service. Does she actually feel unprepared? If so, she shouldn't be confirmed. If not, then she owes the Senate much more clarity and candor. https://t.co/EEjSMYl1UA"
2022-03-23 15:29:30+00:00,Justices Ginsburg and Breyer had no problem defending the Court and slamming the door on partisan court-packing. Judge Jackson won't follow their lead. She carefully keeps that door open and avoids answering the Committee plainly. I’m afraid that speaks volumes. https://t.co/tYQBUbVcYv
2022-03-21 14:58:32+00:00,"The late Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer both publicly opposed court-packing during their tenures. This week, Judge Jackson will be asked if she shares their view on upholding the integrity of the Court. https://t.co/D0orvwCB9S"

2022-03-17 20:17:24+00:00,"Justice Breyer, like the late Justice Ginsburg, is a staunch defender of the Court’s legitimacy and an opponent of far left court-packing plans. This should not be a hard question for his potential replacement. The Senate and the country deserve a clear answer from Judge Jackson. https://t.co/plvoJrpfwh"
2022-03-17 13:22:31+00:00,President Biden needs to step up his game on aid for Ukraine. Their resistance needs more lethal weapon systems that go after not only helicopters but higher-flying planes. We ought to be facilitating this aid right now. https://t.co/dQyFRDYzSk

2022-03-16 16:57:36+00:00,President Zelensky and the people of Ukraine are showing the world incredible bravery and resilience. America cannot stay behind the curve. We must urgently get Ukraine more overdue lethal aid and air defense systems so they can keep up their fight for sovereignty and freedom.
2022-03-15 13:34:55+00:00,Nobody buys Democrats’ efforts to blame 14 months of failed policies on three weeks of crisis in Europe. Inflation and gas prices were skyrocketing and hurting families long before late last month. The White House needs to stop trying to deny their mistakes and start fixing them. https://t.co/rT6GttKS03
2022-03-08 18:16:54+00:00,"I strongly support America stopping purchasing Putin's oil.

We must also recognize that the past year of bad policies from this anti-domestic-energy Administration will make this necessary step more painful than it had to be. Democrats must let Americans produce American energy."
2022-03-03 15:46:38+00:00,I enjoyed meeting Judge Jackson. One crucial Supreme Court qualification is judicial philosophy. The nation needs Justices who uphold the rule of law by applying our laws and Constitution as written. I’ll be studying the Judge’s record and views during the vigorous process ahead.
2022-03-02 22:31:01+00:00,"Tune in now to the @GuyBensonShow. We’ll be discussing energy independence, the Supreme Court, and President Biden’s missed opportunity at the State of the Union last night. https://t.co/HC2JtVXHgB"

2022-03-02 03:50:04+00:00,".@IAGovernor has done a great job leading with common sense through the pandemic. She’s backed the blue, faced down Big Labor to open schools, and fought for parents.

Outstanding speech. After a warmed-over D.C. laundry list, Americans got to hear straight talk &amp; real solutions."
2022-03-02 03:28:15+00:00,"President Biden ignored that his agenda has completely flopped for American families: Raging inflation, open borders, crime. The President did his best to try to pick himself up and provide some level of optimism but that’s not what the American people are feeling right now."
2022-03-01 20:31:11+00:00,Tune in now to @FoxNews. I’m joining @marthamaccallum to discuss tonight’s State of the Union and Ukraine.
2022-03-01 16:04:25+00:00,I’m glad the Americans will hear from @IAGovernor this evening. She’s a strong leader who delivers real solutions for the great people of Iowa. I look forward to hearing her reaction to the President’s remarks and her thoughts on how Washington could better serve Middle America.
2022-02-28 23:43:49+00:00,"The President’s job is to seriously meet the growing threats posed by Russia and China. That starts with investing in our national defense. Our adversaries have prioritized military modernization for decades. We need more investment, not less, to strengthen our own capabilities."
2022-02-25 17:58:08+00:00,"When Senator Jim Inhofe retires, the Senate will lose one of its foremost experts on defense policy, and Oklahoma will lose one of its fiercest advocates.

2022-02-25 15:27:18+00:00,"The Senate must conduct a rigorous, exhaustive review of Judge Jackson’s nomination to the Supreme Court. This is especially crucial as Americans families face major crises that connect directly to our legal system, such as skyrocketing violent crime and open borders."

2022-02-17 21:45:00+00:00,"If Democrats actually wanted to help the American people afford gas, they wouldn’t have spent an entire year waging on American energy.

In one year under President Biden, America went from being a net oil exporter to setting a new record high in oil imports from Russia."
2022-02-17 17:19:49+00:00,"Less than 48 hours after a far-left Black Lives Matter activist tried to literally murder a politician, the radical left bailed their comrade out of jail. It is just jaw-dropping. The innocent people of Louisville deserve better."
2022-02-16 17:28:17+00:00,"Needless school closures. Unscientific child mask mandates. A woke war against merit-based schools and standards.

The far left even opposes basic K-12 transparency. They want parents sidelined and silenced.

Republicans stand with families. The party of parents has your back."
2022-02-15 16:48:54+00:00,"American families are facing the worst inflation in 40 years. The middle 40% of earners have seen their disposable incomes shrink. 

The Democrats who supercharged inflation want working people to trust their political spin over their own pocketbooks. But Americans know better."
2022-02-15 01:00:00+00:00,70% of Americans agree the virus is here to stay &amp; it's time for normalcy. Science tells us kids are at the lowest risk. Classrooms should have been the first places that politicians let get back to normal. But too many Democrat-controlled areas are putting kids and parents last.
2022-02-14 22:07:58+00:00,"Americans who watched the Super Bowl saw rich celebrities having a grand time with hardly a mask in sight. But under many Democrats’ policies, K-12 students who watched that big maskless party on TV last night had to wake up this morning and cover their own faces to go to school."
2022-02-11 20:35:32+00:00,Tolerating lawlessness and anarchy is not compassionate. It doesn’t help vulnerable communities for politicians to passively watch them devolve into war zones. Democrats need to drop the soft-on-crime nonsense and give American families the protection they deserve. https://t.co/UBv6WPZb7m
2022-02-10 21:02:27+00:00,"This all-Democrat government was warned their radical agenda would supercharge inflation and they pushed ahead anyway. Now, rampant inflation and soaring prices are crushing the American people."
2022-02-09 19:02:49+00:00,It is not compassionate to let vulnerable kids grow up in war zones because Democrats feel guilty putting violent criminals behind bars where they belong. Law-abiding citizens across America shouldn't live in fear because liberal public servants won’t do their jobs.
2022-02-09 19:02:42+00:00,Innocent Americans across the country are becoming victims of a violent crime wave. My hometown Louisville set a new all-time murder record last year and averages a carjacking every 42 hours. Democrats have got to quit the radical anti-police rhetoric and soft-on-crime policies.
2022-02-08 16:43:20+00:00,"American workers have been earning pay raises, but the Democrats’ inflation is more than outpacing them. Factoring in inflation, the average American worker has gotten a 2% real pay cut under Democrats’ policies."
2022-02-03 20:31:12+00:00,"Working families can’t afford a Federal Reserve Vice Chair who is itching to raise gas prices, raise energy and heating costs, reduce our energy independence, bankrupt entire industries, and misuse the Fed’s power to kill jobs in Middle America."
2022-02-03 20:30:55+00:00,"The Federal Reserve is supposed to safeguard the American dollar, not enforce a radical agenda the far left can’t get through Congress. But President Biden’s nominee for the number two spot wants our central bank to act like a ‘woke’ super-legislature where citizens get no say."
2022-02-01 17:47:29+00:00,"Democrats' reckless spending has fueled the worst inflation in 40 years. Families are hurting — at the checkout counter, at the gas pump, when they pay their bills.

2022-01-20 17:20:20+00:00,"President Biden took office one year ago.

He's presided over the worst inflation in 40 years. Historic spikes in murders &amp; illegal border crossings. COVID surges, school closures, &amp; illegal mandates. A failed, fatal retreat from Afghanistan. And far-left attacks on institutions. https://t.co/YtJCjPJrvo"
2022-01-20 03:43:16+00:00,"Tonight, nearly every Senate Democrat wrote in permanent ink that they would shatter the soul of the Senate for short-term power. Fortunately, a bipartisan majority saved the Senate and ensured that millions and millions of Americans’ voices will not be silenced."
2022-01-19 19:00:02+00:00,"Democrats' election takeover bill is not a response to any state law. It is a sweeping, radical power grab that they first drafted in 2019.

Bureaucrats would get new power to police citizens' online speech. The federal government would start directly funding political campaigns."
2022-01-19 18:05:00+00:00,The left's fake panic over voting is collapsing. Less than 0.5% of Americans say this is a top priority. Even the media is pointing out that Georgia’s law is more open than Delaware or New York. And more citizens say voting laws are too loose than say they are too restrictive.
2022-01-18 20:07:17+00:00,"Last week, the same Democrats who’ve been raging against the Senate’s 60-vote threshold used the 60-vote threshold to block Russia sanctions.

Today, they’re back to saying it’s an evil rule.

They've quit even pretending this is principled. They just want total one-party power."

2022-01-05 18:52:13+00:00,"No party that would break the Senate can be trusted to seize unprecedented control over all 50 states’ election laws.

2021-02-09 16:15:39+00:00,"For the three and a half decades that my friend Richard Shelby has served in the Senate, the people of Alabama have had a true heavyweight champion in their corner. I’m glad our friend still has two more years to continue his important and effective work here in the Capitol."
2021-02-08 22:21:04+00:00,"Democrats' so-called relief bill includes Sen. Sanders’s minimum wage proposal that would kill 1.4M American jobs. This after the President killed many thousands of jobs with Keystone XL.

Killing jobs and destroying opportunity — that's their idea of pandemic relief?"
2021-02-08 22:20:56+00:00,"Democrats admitted last March: They see the pandemic as an opportunity to ram through ideological change. 

That's why they are now pushing a sprawling $1.9T plan that even liberal economists say is poorly targeted to the urgent needs of our nation."
2021-02-07 21:49:31+00:00,"George Shultz was one of the great Americans of our time. Nobody better exemplified a thoughtful, principled, and patriotic commitment to public service. A scholar-statesman for the ages. My full statement: https://t.co/lC8r9mNmm1"
2021-02-04 16:26:36+00:00,"Pres. Biden's own scientists agree school appears to be quite safe and we should get our kids back.

Congress sent massive sums for K-12 schools in 2020. Hardly any of it has been spent yet.

Federal funding is not the issue. It's Big Labor moving the goalposts on kids &amp; parents."
2021-02-03 22:12:08+00:00,"We’ve heard a lot of talk about unity, but White House staff and congressional Democrats are working from the opposite playbook. Senate Republicans will be ready and waiting with a host of amendments to improve the rushed procedural step that’s being jammed through. https://t.co/HjAPLAg2Ae"
2021-02-03 18:54:18+00:00,"Science tells us that in-person school can be safe — and is crucial for children’s futures. We cannot keep this essential part of our society on indefinite hiatus.

No more goalpost-moving from Big Labor. Kids have sacrificed enough. States and districts need to get this done."
2021-02-03 17:33:21+00:00,"This morning, Congress honored Officer Brian D. Sicknick under the dome of the institution he swore to defend — and died defending. 
 
In the face of lawlessness, Officer Sicknick paid the ultimate price. His name will never be forgotten. https://t.co/sn7siRkQMh"
2021-02-02 23:47:11+00:00,First Navalny was poisoned. Now he’s been jailed. Peaceful protesters across Russia are being suppressed. Just the latest in Putin’s long campaign to subvert democracy and the rule of law. The U.S. and our allies must continue strong measures to hold Putin and cronies to account.
2021-02-02 18:10:49+00:00,I’ve had good conversations with @POTUS and @SecBlinken about the need for a swift and decisive response from the U.S. and allies following the coup in Burma. Expect the Administration will quickly sanction the junta and defend democracy.
2021-02-02 17:20:12+00:00,I’ve voted for several of President Biden’s mainstream cabinet nominees. But his choice to run Homeland Security was blasted by the Obama Administration’s own Inspector General for running an immigration law favor factory for powerful Democrats. Bad pick with major ethics issues.
2021-02-01 15:08:34+00:00,I call on Burma’s military to immediately release the civilian political leaders of the country and turn back from this abyss. We need to support the people of Burma in their journey toward democracy and impose costs on those who stand in their way. My full statement: https://t.co/C2uOjnIVQx
2021-01-29 21:27:41+00:00,"The last four years showed U.S. prosperity, domestic energy security, and reducing emissions do not have to conflict.
 
This Piecemeal Green New Deal through liberal executive orders gets it dead wrong.
 
There's nothing ""green"" about a tsunami of pink slips for American workers."
2021-01-26 23:09:37+00:00,"Today, I made clear that if Democrats ever attack the key Senate rules, it would drain the consent and comity out of the institution. A scorched-earth Senate would hardly be able to function. It wouldn’t be a progressive’s dream. It would be a nightmare.

I guarantee it."
2021-01-26 21:58:43+00:00,"The Senate requires collaboration and deliberation. It’s a feature, not a bug, that slim majorities can't ram through half-baked ideas.

My remarks on the legislative filibuster and why I stuck up for the minority’s rights even when Republicans had power: https://t.co/vtKFPDeVJe"
2021-01-26 02:14:26+00:00,"I’m glad that two Senate Democrats confirmed today they will not vote to end the legislative filibuster. They agree with President Biden and me on protecting the Senate.
 
With this win, we can move forward with a 50-50 power-sharing agreement built on the 2001 precedent. https://t.co/fHUCFxxXh8"

2021-01-21 20:40:03+00:00,"The failed Paris deal will hurt American families while China and Russia grow emissions.

The Keystone cancellation will kill union jobs and hurt U.S. energy security.

And a proposal to gut immigration enforcement and give blanket amnesty?

Rough ""day one"" for American workers."
2021-01-21 18:09:30+00:00,"Minority rights on legislation are key to the Senate. President Biden spent decades defending them. More than two dozen Senate Democrats backed them just four years ago.

This isn't complicated. Simply reaffirming that Democrats won't break the rules should not be a heavy lift."
2021-01-20 23:25:31+00:00,"Today, before the entire world, the greatest nation in history carried out another peaceful transfer of power.

Congratulations to President Biden and Vice President Harris. I look forward to working together everywhere we can and differing respectfully when we must."
2021-01-19 19:47:57+00:00,"Tomorrow a new POTUS and VPOTUS will be sworn in. It will be secure because many other brave Americans have sworn their own oaths to support and defend our Constitution.
 
Thanks to the Capitol Police and all the federal &amp; local personnel helping protect our democracy this week."
2021-01-18 12:56:55+00:00,"Today we honor one of our nation’s

2021-01-07 18:48:16+00:00,The ultimate blame for yesterday’s events lies with the unhinged criminals who tried to disrupt our government and with those who incited them.
