2022-10-16 23:17:49+00:00,Gun violence is something I approach as a father to two young children and as a pastor who has sat with families who’ve lost loved ones to senseless gun violence.
2022-10-16 23:17:07+00:00,"This year in the Senate, we passed the most significant progress on gun violence prevention in three decades. I was proud to support it."
2022-10-16 23:14:38+00:00,"It’s unfortunate that Herschel Walker said he’d debate me “any time, any place,” but refused to show up tonight."
2022-10-16 23:13:56+00:00,"Unlike Herschel Walker, I will always show up for Georgia."
2022-10-16 23:13:28+00:00,"Herschel Walker has lied about his companies, his education, his family, and his past. He's falsely claimed to be in law enforcement. He's defrauded veterans, and ripped off charity after charity.

He is not ready."
2022-10-16 23:12:59+00:00,This race is about who is ready to represent the people of Georgia. And from Herschel Walker's words and actions it is clear he is anything but ready.
2022-10-16 23:12:11+00:00,"The Inflation Reduction Act included my measures to cap insulin at $35 per month for Georgians on Medicare, along with my measure to cap seniors drug costs at $2,000."
2022-10-16 23:11:41+00:00,"I helped pass legislation signed into law earlier this year to alleviate supply chain issues, support Georgia jobs, and hold shipping companies accountable for price-gouging."
2022-10-16 23:11:15+00:00,"Herschel, why did you oppose this legislation to save our seniors money at the pharmacy counter?"
2022-10-16 23:10:45+00:00,"I’ve taken aim at our oil and gas companies, and at shipping companies raking in record profits while Georgia businesses pay record prices. Georgians can count on me to continue the fight to cut costs for folks in every corner of our state."
2022-10-16 23:09:45+00:00,Oftentimes doing what’s best for Georgia means working across the aisle.
2022-10-16 23:09:36+00:00,Mr. Walker failed to show up tonight. He's not ready. https://t.co/I3BrFWlfaQ
2022-10-16 23:08:15+00:00,"Just this year, the Lugar Center rated me one of the most bipartisan senators in the entire U.S. Senate."
2022-10-16 23:07:20+00:00,"I took out loans when I was a student at Morehouse College, and I was able to pay them off years later. But I also understand that today it’s much harder to pay those loans off."
2022-10-16 23:06:53+00:00,"Whether you went to a two-year college, a four-year college, or trade school, many of our young people today are graduating with a mortgage before they even have the chance to get a mortgage. That’s why I’ve pushed for action that provides relief to Georgians."
2022-10-16 23:05:55+00:00,I learned from my father – who was a veteran and a pastor – that we need to start each day ready to serve each other and our communities.
2022-10-16 23:04:07+00:00,"Early Voting begins Monday, October 17th, Georgia!"
2022-10-16 23:03:36+00:00,Herschel Walker is asking the people of Georgia for a job without showing up for the job interview.
2022-10-16 23:01:28+00:00,"“Any time, any place” huh? https://t.co/AoDMemlXRQ"

2022-10-16 22:21:19+00:00,Maybe Herschel Walker refuses to show up for tonight’s debate because he ran out of talking points on Friday.
2022-10-16 22:10:11+00:00,"Herschel Walker said “any time, any place” but refused to show up tonight."
2022-10-16 21:53:45+00:00,"Despite Herschel’s refusal to show up for Georgians, I’ll be on that debate stage ready to talk about the issues that matter most to folks in every corner of our state."

2022-10-14 23:55:39+00:00,"From this year’s decision to strip away a core protection of women to make their own health care decisions – something my opponent celebrated – to threats against marriage equality, we are seeing troubling divides."
2022-10-14 23:54:59+00:00,"Right now, for the first time in decades, we are seeing rights being taken away rather than expanded in this country."
2022-10-14 23:52:54+00:00,"I support our law enforcement. My opponent pretends to be law enforcement.

My opponent has a problem with the truth. https://t.co/xNxuRgvZTH"
2022-10-14 23:51:57+00:00,"I’ll work with anyone, Republican or Democrat, if it means helping the people of this state."
2022-10-14 23:51:06+00:00,"I’ve proven I’m willing to work across the aisle, or stand up to the president, when it’s right for Georgia."
2022-10-14 23:49:57+00:00,I never thought I’d say this: but I even worked with Texas Senator Ted Cruz because it made sense for Georgia.
2022-10-14 23:49:35+00:00,I worked with the Republican Senator from Alabama to remove regulations and stand up for our peanut farmers.
2022-10-14 23:49:03+00:00,"I stood up to the Biden Administration’s proposed cuts to Georgia’s military bases and successfully pushed the White House to secure millions of dollars to address supply chain issues, lower costs, and bring even more jobs to the Port of Savannah."
2022-10-14 23:47:40+00:00,I was proud to work with Republican Congressman Buddy Carter to put an end to President Biden’s plan to close the Savannah Combat Readiness Training Center.
2022-10-14 23:46:50+00:00,"Affordable health care is a moral imperative. Dr. King said, “Of all the injustices, inequality in health care is the most shocking and the most inhumane.” 

We must close the coverage gap by expanding Medicaid in Georgia."
2022-10-14 23:46:28+00:00,"I’ve been focused on health care long before I ran for the Senate. As a pastor, I have been fighting for equitable access to health care because I believe health care is a human right."
2022-10-14 23:45:34+00:00,Georgia is one of 12 states that has not expanded Medicaid. Herschel Walker wants it to stay that way.
2022-10-14 23:45:07+00:00,"Herschel Walker opposes expanding Medicaid, which would benefit more than 640,000 Georgians and create jobs right here in Georgia."
2022-10-14 23:44:42+00:00,Expand Medicaid.
2022-10-14 23:44:17+00:00,I introduced the Medicaid Saves Lives Act to close the Medicaid gap in Georgia.

2022-10-14 23:42:08+00:00,My opponent is not ready to represent the people of Georgia.
2022-10-14 23:40:42+00:00,"Herschel Walker has lied about his companies, his education, his family, and his past. He's falsely claimed to be in law enforcement. He's defrauded veterans, and ripped off charity after charity.

He is not ready."
2022-10-14 23:39:54+00:00,This race is about who is ready to represent the people of Georgia. And from Herschel Walker's words and actions it is clear he is anything but ready.
2022-10-14 23:38:28+00:00,"You can’t believe what Herschel Walker says about himself, so you certainly can’t believe what he says about me."
2022-10-14 23:37:44+00:00,"My parents were both pastors. Growing up, I watched them build and uplift the communities they preached in. And I was inspired to carry their torch of public service by bringing people together."

2022-10-14 23:36:05+00:00,My path from Kayton Homes to the pulpit of Ebenezer and on to the Senate wasn’t paved with luck or fortune – it was made possible by smart public policy like the Head Start program that prepared me for the classroom and Pell Grants that helped fund my education at Morehouse.
2022-10-14 23:34:00+00:00,"Herschel Walker lied about working with law enforcement.
https://t.co/luSuCNcRep"
2022-10-14 23:33:34+00:00,"I supported the highest funding levels for the COPS hiring program for local law enforcement organizations in more than 10 years – funding that will help police departments train, prepare, and keep our communities safe."
2022-10-14 23:32:48+00:00,We must do more to support local law enforcement agencies. Take it from Burke County Sheriff Alfonzo Williams. https://t.co/NCYoNbvKnp
2022-10-14 23:31:25+00:00,"My Invest to Protect Act supports small law enforcement agencies in Georgia and across the country with the training, equipment, and mental health support they need. It passed in the Senate unanimously."
2022-10-14 23:30:56+00:00,Gun violence is something I approach as a father to two young children and as a pastor who has sat with families who’ve lost loved ones to senseless gun violence.
2022-10-14 23:30:18+00:00,"This year in the Senate, we passed the most significant progress on gun violence prevention in three decades. I was proud to support it."
2022-10-14 23:24:36+00:00,We simply have to make higher education and training opportunities more affordable.
2022-10-14 23:23:47+00:00,"Whether you went to a two-year college, a four-year college, or trade school, many of our young people today are graduating with a mortgage before they even have the chance to get a mortgage. That’s why I’ve pushed for action that provides relief to Georgians."
2022-10-14 23:23:36+00:00,My opponent doesn't believe in capping the costs of prescription drugs. https://t.co/7VBDdlylEQ
2022-10-14 23:23:17+00:00,"I took out loans when I was a student at Morehouse College, and I was able to pay them off years later. But I also understand that today it’s much harder to pay those loans off."
2022-10-14 23:22:30+00:00,Herschel Walker thinks it’s a problem there isn’t already a national abortion ban. https://t.co/PsQpCXlekw
2022-10-14 23:20:12+00:00,"I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, Herschel Walker is not ready to represent Georgia."
2022-10-14 23:18:47+00:00,"As a pastor and a man of faith, I have a profound reverence for life and an abiding respect for choice. Women in this country have a fundamental right to make their own health care decisions with their doctors — not politicians."
2022-10-14 23:17:55+00:00,"A patient’s room is too cramped for a woman, her doctor, and the U.S. government."
2022-10-14 23:17:31+00:00,"This summer, Herschel Walker celebrated the end of a core protection for women to make their own health care decisions."
2022-10-14 23:16:29+00:00,"My opponent would be a vote for a national abortion ban, and has said repeatedly that he thinks there should be no exceptions for rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother."
2022-10-14 23:15:32+00:00,"Early Voting begins Monday, October 17th, Georgia!"
2022-10-14 23:13:37+00:00,"We've come a long way in advancing voting rights, but we've got to continue the good fight to ensure all eligible voices are heard in every election."
2022-10-14 23:13:11+00:00,Voting is a sacred right that deserves the highest respect and protection by our government. That’s why I have continued fighting to protect voting rights in the United States Senate.
2022-10-14 23:12:28+00:00,"Voting rights are preservative of all other rights. I believe that the right to vote is sacred, and that a vote is a kind of prayer for the world we want to live in. And our elections must be fair, open, and safe for every eligible citizen."
2022-10-14 23:11:28+00:00,"There's no doubt Georgians are hurting, which is why I have made lowering costs, growing good paying jobs, and strengthening our economy a central priority."
2022-10-14 23:10:36+00:00,"Herschel, why did you oppose this legislation to save our seniors money at the pharmacy counter?"

2022-10-14 23:08:39+00:00,"Right now, Georgians are being forced to pay record prices while corporations are seeing record profits. That isn’t right."
2022-10-14 23:05:39+00:00,"At the end of the day this election is about who’s ready to represent the people of Georgia, and that choice is clear."
2022-10-14 23:05:00+00:00,"It’s so good to be in my hometown of Savannah, just a few miles from where I grew up in Kayton Homes public housing.

It’s where I learned the importance of faith, hard work, caring for your neighbor, and pushing to create what Dr. King called the “Beloved Community.”"
