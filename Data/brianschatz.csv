2022-12-27 20:22:14+00:00,"@ValerieRoss14 Respectfully, I believe considering the “type of resident who might do a certain thing that bothers others,” ie make noise, should make folks who know history of post Jim Crow zoning laws a bit nervous. And whether CEQA was written to cover “student noise.”"
2022-12-26 18:32:06+00:00,There is nothing progressive about a law that prevents student housing because students might make noise. It is literally “get off my lawn” with the veneer of conservation.

2022-12-23 19:49:37+00:00,My Communications Director is on vacay ask me anything.
2022-12-23 05:42:51+00:00,"“And I believe we can convince homeowners that affordable and abundant housing is in their interest because, like everyone else — their children, their coworkers, their friends, their employees — they are house consumers.” https://t.co/fbZHR6a0Mb"
2022-12-23 04:02:31+00:00,"And my Transpo Housing and Urban Development staff. Probably the hardest Omnibus ever. Increases for affordable housing, a new program - YIMBY - to incentivize zoning reforms. Super patriotic and smart people who scarcely got any sleep to write this bill over last week. 3/3"
2022-12-23 03:58:51+00:00,"And my Senate Committee on Indian Affairs Staff. Historic success - by far the biggest investments in native communities in  history, and important bills on language, water, culture, health. Brilliant people who do this because they know if they don’t do it, it won’t happen. 2/3"
2022-12-23 03:55:44+00:00,"Shout out to my staff. My Hawaii office - impeccable professionalism and constituent service, integrating DC policy w Hawaii needs. Shout out to DC shop - brilliant people with deep expertise set an example for being excellent and effective while not being jerks. 1/3"
2022-12-23 03:45:13+00:00,Spare me with this “team normal” crap these people enabled him along the way. I’m glad they didn’t support a literal overthrow of the government but they backed up the guy who did until the bitter end.
2022-12-22 22:57:16+00:00,"Inflation Reduction Act/American Rescue Plan/Gun Safety/Chips/Marriage Equality/PACT/OMNI/UKRAINE aid/postal reform/ECA/Infrastructure/ thank you for trusting us with power. Always more to do, but a good body of work. Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, happy holidays."
2022-12-21 03:41:57+00:00,"I’m not sure if Trump runs or doesn’t but just because the tax return thing was fought in 2016 doesn’t mean it’s old news. And while we are at it, just because “emoluments” sounds weird doesn’t mean it’s not also disqualifying."
2022-12-19 19:29:11+00:00,"“I was wrong about the January 6 Committee and I apologize. In my zeal to find a contrary take, I wrongly declared that nobody cares about democracy  in an election context. I was morally and strategically wrong.” -No Pundit, 2022"

2022-12-16 15:34:34+00:00,Still taking a wait and see attitude on this platform but I gotta say that so far this site is getting less serious and more boring at the same time.
2022-12-16 03:53:12+00:00,Content moderation is like what Churchill said about democracy - it is the worst system except for all the others.
2022-12-16 02:28:27+00:00,"And this bill on its way to the President’s desk also has a bunch of very important other ocean protections bills, authored by @SenWhitehouseand others, and including a coral reef bill w @marcorubio. By far the biggest package of oceans legislation in many years."

Thanks to @CoryBooker and @SenatorCantwell and @SenSchumer and @SpeakerPelosi for making this happen. A shark fin ban was the first bill I passed when I was 26, so for me this is full circle."

2022-12-13 04:47:12+00:00,"Kevin Mcarthy needs the vote of people who tried to overthrow the government in order to be Speaker, so when his actions are covered next year, it’s not just a “right wing base” or a “razor thin margin,” but that he needs insurrectionist votes to achieve and maintain power."

2022-12-10 19:47:21+00:00,"I’m flabbergasted that the newspaper of record in the United States is still being obtuse about American politics. This last article takes an obvious thing and makes it hazy. This one isn’t a big deal, frankly, except that given the past 7 years it just feels like stubbornness."
2022-12-10 03:58:37+00:00,FYI this organization is regularly invited to testify in Congress on lots of issues and they are treated like a serious think tank.
2022-12-09 03:16:05+00:00,"Props to @GaryPeters and @chuckschumer. There is a lot of ink spilled when we screw things up, and that’s fair enough. But this was a smart strategy, expertly executed by these two and their teams, the campaigns, a ton of grassroots orgs, and literally millions of Americans."
2022-12-09 02:36:33+00:00,"Content moderation is often screwed up on social media platforms because it can be 1) arbitrary 2) done by AI 3) understaffed/underfunded 4) political. But we will miss it terribly if it’s gone. Everyone’s user experience will suck, and the cesspool would be unimaginably awful."
2022-12-08 18:05:19+00:00,@jonfavs I just wanted to say I like this tweet but I’m unwilling to retweet it.

2022-12-02 18:06:37+00:00,"I remember center-left political “experts” aggressively, angrily decrying Democrats for focusing on this. A leader’s job is to influence public opinion, not follow it blindly. And political analysts should focus on what matters most, not what they think someone else cares about."

2022-11-26 19:05:10+00:00,Being dedicated to Jerusalem as the eventual location of the rapture does not make you a friend of the Jewish people. It means you think we are all going to eventually convert to your religion.
2022-11-26 16:23:39+00:00,“I am (confidentially and off the record) appalled at Trump dining with anti semites. There is no (again to reiterate this is on background and not for attribution) place for him in our Party. This is the final straw (unless it looks like he’s winning and then I’m all in.)”
2022-11-26 02:40:21+00:00,"I don’t give a &amp;$#! what some republicans are saying off the record about Trump dining with antisemites. At this point anything less than a clean, public break is just taking us all for fools."

2022-11-24 18:44:43+00:00,Duck is better than turkey. Some traditions are worth reconsidering.
2022-11-21 02:37:57+00:00,I don’t think they can continue to operate in almost total secrecy and without a code of ethics as if that is somehow essential to their independence.
2022-11-21 01:01:48+00:00,This is excellent.
2022-11-20 20:18:50+00:00,Not enough is made of the fact that there are two NFL starting quarterbacks from the island of Oahu. So cool to watch @Tua and @_marcusmariota play football every Sunday. 🤙🏽

2022-11-16 01:48:10+00:00,The main thing you need to know about Trump announcing for re-election is that Raphael Warnock is in a runoff and it’s exactly 3 weeks from now and we don’t just need money we need it kinda fast.  https://t.co/wwIlpFp6iP
2022-11-16 01:14:54+00:00,Hey @ossoff @ChrisMurphyCT @CoryBooker @Bob_Casey should we try to raise a bunch of money for Raphael Warnock today? IT IS THREE WEEKS AWAY!

2022-11-14 11:58:37+00:00,@BrentToderian I can guess the grocery bill with weird precision.
2022-11-13 23:28:29+00:00,@BenjySarlin @NateSilver538 Yeah that’s the only reason I’m not too declarative. I don’t think we know this is in the rear view.
2022-11-13 23:25:07+00:00,"@NateSilver538 I’m just being cautious, man. I read a book of yours that encouraged this kind of caution."
2022-11-13 23:11:15+00:00,I am reluctant to be too optimistic but this seems like a genuinely good sign. We all benefit if election denial is proven to be an electoral loser and is thrown on the dust heap of history.
2022-11-13 19:54:06+00:00,They call it ballot harvesting because “plenty of people voting conveniently” doesn’t sound scary.

I understand it’s not politically wise for Dems to yell “Trump Trump Trump” but there’s an open plan to overturn the American experiment."
2021-12-10 04:54:07+00:00,"The principal going forward is that in exchange for helping, even indirectly, the country to uphold its full faith and credit, you get absolutely nothing. Just like you don’t give an employee a promotion or a raise for showing up for work in the morning."

2021-11-29 02:26:24+00:00,"@jbarro I have said on here that we cannot run on an anti trump platform when he’s not on the ballot. But turning fascism into a tactical question is hard to swallow. Like, we are not literally all operatives. We can be citizens first."
2021-11-29 02:18:20+00:00,@jbarro Describing  fascism accurately seems important. Whether it helps electorally - I don’t know.  But the media should be as precise and unflinching as possible.

And that’s why we should do this, even if the 25th is invoked, even if Trump calms down and flies to Florida and the threat wanes. It’s not just about the next 12 days. It’s about America’s future."

To avoid preventable hospitalizations and deaths, we need for everyone to be good to each other and avoid gatherings.

2021-01-08 02:42:13+00:00,I have a book coming out and if don’t give me an advance on it you are violating my first amendment rights.
2021-01-08 00:04:32+00:00,"The 1st amendment is still totally available to you, and you also have the Speech or Debate Clause as a Senator. This isn’t about the 1st or any other amendment. This is a private company deciding that it’s bad for their reputation to be associated with what you are doing."
2021-01-07 23:06:23+00:00,The Capitol Police leadership turned down backup. My blood is boiling.
2021-01-07 22:50:33+00:00,"There were more bodies, and more backup, and more arrests, when activists were fighting for healthcare. This is not just an operational failure. It is a catastrophic moral failure. We don’t just need reform and new procedures, we need new leadership. Trust cannot be rebuilt."
2021-01-07 20:23:29+00:00,"Trump is a danger to democracy itself. I took an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. We must both initiate impeachment proceedings in the House and invoke the 25th Amendment. Our vigilance must increase, not wane, in the final days."

2021-01-07 13:16:30+00:00,"An aspect of preventing this from reoccurring is those who enabled it cannot slide back into their cable pundit, Davos, Wall St, Aspen Institute circuit. The price for supporting an autocrat is you don’t get to opine on Section 230, or tax rates, or whatever. Go away forever."
2021-01-07 12:52:42+00:00,"Forgive me a few disjointed thoughts: A) The number of Senators supporting a coup went from 13 to 7 yesterday. That is 7 too many, but 7 is better than 13.

2021-01-07 05:18:08+00:00,U.S. Capitol security needs a total overhaul. The physical breaching and desecration of our temple of democracy must never happen again. This was plainly a failure.

Our role is ministerial, like a glorified Notary Public. We don’t have the authority to turn off democracy."
