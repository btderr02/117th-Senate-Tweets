2021-01-13 23:53:00+00:00,"The President encouraged &amp; incited insurrection, which was intended to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power. Now that the House has rightly impeached him we should act quickly in the Senate to convict him, remove him from office &amp; bar him from holding office again."
2021-01-13 20:17:00+00:00,"If we allow this democracy to be changed by use of force, rather than by use of words, we have lost our democracy—&amp; I won't let that happen. This President must be impeached &amp; removed, &amp; those responsible for last week's violence must be held accountable. https://t.co/NP7nEXwrWW"

2021-01-11 22:35:48+00:00,"Like so many staff &amp; members, I was honored to know Capitol Police Officer Howie Liebengood. Officer Liebengood was often stationed at a door near my office where he greeted everyone with a smile and sincere kindness. My heart breaks for his family &amp; friends."
2021-01-11 22:00:00+00:00,The Trump Administration must fix its vaccine distribution failures—which are unnecessarily prolonging this pandemic. We need a comprehensive national plan ASAP. https://t.co/driUaXnXVU
2021-01-08 19:03:32+00:00,"At the end of the day, our job is to keep this country a democracy where voices win, not brute force. Any Senator who stands up and supports the power of force over the power of democracy has broken their oath of office. Senators Hawley and Cruz should resign."
2021-01-08 19:03:32+00:00,"This is not how we keep our people and our country free. As a Senator, I respect every member who disagrees with my ideas. I reserve my right to use my voice to fight for what I believe in."
2021-01-08 19:03:32+00:00,"There can be no normalizing or looking away from what played out before our eyes this week. The violent mob that attacked the Capitol was made up of people who don’t accept democracy, and want to take this country by use of force."

2021-01-08 19:03:31+00:00,"I come to the Capitol every day to fight for what I believe in. I often have issues I feel very strongly about—whether it’s a woman’s right to choose, or immigration, or health care, or the issue of the day."
2021-01-08 14:40:58+00:00,"If Betsy DeVos really wanted to stand up to the President, she would have stayed and called for invoking the 25th Amendment."
2021-01-07 21:09:00+00:00,"The most immediate way for President Trump to be removed from office is for the @VP &amp; the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment. If they don’t, to protect our democracy, our clear responsibility as members of Congress is to impeach, remove, &amp; bar this President from future office."
2021-01-07 18:29:27+00:00,"Because of you, we will soon have a President and Senate determined to protect and strengthen rather than jeopardize our democratic institutions. Continue to have faith in yourselves, each other, and our democracy, and we will get through this together."
2021-01-07 18:29:27+00:00,"To families in Washington state and across the country, please know that as frightening as this past day has been, there is reason for hope because of your participation in the very same processes the President is seeking to undermine."

2021-01-06 23:09:00+00:00,"This violent mob &amp; the President who stoked their rage must be held accountable. They should not be allowed to delay our democratic processes for a minute longer.

We have a Constitutional duty to certify the election. We should resume that work right now and finish tonight."
2021-01-06 20:50:00+00:00,"In response to questions about my safety: I'm safe and so is my staff, but I condemn in the strongest terms the hate-fueled violence we are seeing in our nation's Capitol today, as should every leader committed to the peaceful transfer of power in our country."
2021-01-06 17:35:00+00:00,"On January 20, @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris will be sworn in as the next President and Vice President of the United States.

2021-01-06 16:10:00+00:00,"Thank you, thank you, thank you to Stacey Abrams and every organizer and voter in Georgia. You showed once again that every voice matters and every one of us can make change."
2021-01-05 22:30:00+00:00,This chaos could have been avoided with a comprehensive national vaccines plan—which I've been telling the Trump Administration for months. People seeking vaccines need clear information from the federal gov't and I'll keep working to help them get it. https://t.co/4FysVcln1l
2021-01-05 20:15:00+00:00,The pandemic has only exacerbated the challenges faced by people suffering from opioid and other substance use disorders—and we have to make sure our response and eventual recovery provides the resources needed to address this crisis head-on. https://t.co/zlQU7HzPOd
2021-01-05 18:43:26+00:00,"As hospitals across the country struggle to keep up with the growing cases of COVID-19, we all need to step up and keep doing our part to slow the spread of this virus—including wearing a mask, social distancing, and washing your hands."
2021-01-05 16:29:00+00:00,"Late last week, I got the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine at the advice of the Capitol physician.

2021-01-04 20:15:00+00:00,".@realDonaldTrump is spending his last days in office undermining our democracy because he didn’t get what he wanted. It’s not surprising, raises serious &amp; potentially criminal legal concerns, &amp; won’t work. These actions are dangerous &amp; every elected official should reject them."

Wear a mask
Social distance
