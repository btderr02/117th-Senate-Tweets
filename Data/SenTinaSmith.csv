2021-01-22 23:24:59+00:00,"I was a teenager when Roe v. Wade was decided. That moment felt like an incredible time of progress for women. 

Today, on the 48th anniversary of the historic ruling, I stand ready to continue the work we still must do to advance all people's freedom in health care and beyond."

2021-01-22 20:06:46+00:00,Glad to see this among Biden’s Day 1 actions. Many Liberian Minnesotans have been here for 30 years – they deserve the opportunity to become citizens. I fought hard alongside the community to pass the Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act to provide that opportunity.

2021-01-22 03:09:55+00:00,"Sens. Cruz and Hawley deserve a fair process and a chance to explain themselves and their role in the January 6 Capitol siege. 
 
But unless we learn something new, based on what we’ve seen so far, I don’t believe they deserve to remain in the Senate."
2021-01-21 21:25:52+00:00,"Was a pleasure speaking with @DebHaalandNM today. I am inspired by her life story, her leadership, and the work we can do together.

2021-01-20 16:42:37+00:00,"When I first came to the Senate, Kamala was one of the first people to reach out to me in real friendship. She made me pasta and bucked me up. She is warm, strong, smart. 

Our grandson Ari will never know a world where a woman can’t be Vice President, or President."
2021-01-20 16:21:26+00:00,It’s snowing. And as a Minnesotan I consider this a very good sign. #InaugurationDay

2021-01-15 21:34:29+00:00,"I've worked with @ASlavitt on health policy since I first arrived in the Senate. He's a good friend and a seasoned expert, and the country is lucky to have him serve as a senior advisor for Biden's COVID response. 

Congrats Andy from one Minnesotan to another."
2021-01-15 20:57:25+00:00,Mitch McConnell has been the master of obstruction in the Senate. He’s really good at figuring out how not to make things happen. But the Democrats are in charge now. And we’re ready to move hell or high water to get things done for Americans. More of what I told @allinwithchris: https://t.co/d2kcgY3Ojv
2021-01-15 20:43:15+00:00,"How many of you had more than one important thing you had to get done this week? Right.

2021-01-14 23:00:28+00:00,"2020 was tied for the hottest year on record, another sign showing just how badly Trump has failed to combat climate change. But help is on the way. Excited to see Minnesotan Cecilia Martinez appointed as a climate advisor for Joe Biden. Excellent choice.

2021-01-14 22:02:00+00:00,Donald Trump has been impeached. Twice. He incited an insurrection that resulted in loss of life while the nation watched in horror. The Senate must convict and prevent him from holding office ever again.
2021-01-13 20:30:43+00:00,You know things are bad when you need a suit just devoted to impeachments.
2021-01-13 17:44:55+00:00,"Hundreds of troops protecting our country are sleeping in the U.S. Capitol, an image you’d expect from the Civil War.

2021-01-12 02:46:27+00:00,"3. Show you understand that the legislative branch of our gov’t was violently attacked by right-wing domestic terrorists. This may not be your fault (unless you are Cruz, Hawley, or one of the others who helped incite this attack) but you can make a difference by condemning it."
2021-01-12 02:46:27+00:00,"2. Acknowledge that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won the election and will be President and Vice President. Say that, for the good of the country, you wish them the best."
2021-01-12 02:46:27+00:00,"To Republican elected leaders: There’s lots of talk today about moving forward and “healing.” Here are some ideas for how you can help. 1. Say out loud that America had a free and fair election in November.  If you had a winning election, point that out."

2021-01-07 02:45:26+00:00,"We will get through this day. I truly believe our democracy is resilient and can withstand this desperate coup attempt.

2021-01-07 02:45:25+00:00,"Today’s attacks on the U.S. Capitol and federal buildings strike at the core principle of our democracy, that the people decide who represents them. The seditionists were incited by the most destructive and anti-democratic President in our history. [1/5]"
