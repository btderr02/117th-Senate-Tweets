2021-08-16 21:54:40+00:00,"While I believe it is now time to bring our troops home, we also must continue working to maintain humanitarian and diplomatic support for Afghanistan to ensure the country does not again become a safe haven for al-Qaeda."
2021-08-16 21:54:40+00:00,"The U.S. went into Afghanistan in 2001 to defeat those who attacked the U.S. on 9/11, and 10 years later, we found and killed Osama bin Laden. We stayed an additional decade to help train Afghan security forces and create conditions for a more stable future in that country."
2021-08-16 21:54:39+00:00,"What we are seeing unfold in Afghanistan is devastating. At this time, we must do everything we can to prioritize the evacuation of U.S. personnel, Afghan partners, journalists, women leaders, activists, human rights defenders, and others."

2021-08-04 13:15:01+00:00,The tragic death of the Pentagon police officer yesterday reminds us how much we owe to law enforcement who keep us safe. We need police reform—just like we need Congressional reform—but we should always honor the service of those who put themselves in harm’s way to keep us safe.
2021-08-03 13:31:58+00:00,"Incredibly sad news. My heart is with Officer DeFreytag’s loved ones.

2021-07-29 19:12:29+00:00,"For the past four years, every week was ""infrastructure week"" in the Trump Administration, and yet every week was the same—we'd get no deal. Six months into the Biden-Harris Administration, we've got a deal. This is what competent leadership looks like!"
2021-07-29 17:05:47+00:00,"The American Rescue Plan we passed was one of the boldest pieces of legislation in American history, and families are seeing that investment pay off with a strong economy and money in their pockets. Remember: Passed by one vote with only Democrats supporting it. Elections matter!"
2021-07-28 17:17:59+00:00,"This is frankly ridiculous. Trashing a government institution that’s announcing recommendations (not mandates) to keep people safe will only weaken people's trust, at a time when we desperately need to do the opposite."

Grateful Dems in Congress and @POTUS were able to make this happen."
2021-07-14 20:03:48+00:00,"The budget agreement we have announced is a historic investment in America's economy and families. From bringing down the cost of childcare and health care to expanding early childhood education to fighting climate change, this is transformative."

2021-07-01 15:23:47+00:00,Today’s decision demonstrates that the Supreme Court can no longer be counted upon to preserve the right fundamental to all other rights. Congress must pass comprehensive voting rights legislation—now.
2021-06-29 20:03:22+00:00,"Proud and grateful that Virginia is securing the right to vote. But too many states are going in the opposite direction—so we MUST protect voting rights at the federal level. This is of existential importance, and we need to get it done. https://t.co/ahvMMJtdnK"

2021-06-23 17:44:58+00:00,"And so, surrounded by his friends and family, I address John Warner as he used to address me—“Well old friend, today you are at home.”"
2021-06-23 17:44:58+00:00,"But today I celebrate John's impact over a three decade tenure in the Senate. The family he created from Senate colleagues—not just Senators, but committee staff, Capitol Police, food service workers, Senate gym employees. The ever-present curiosity and twinkle in the eye he had."
2021-06-23 17:44:57+00:00,"John Warner saw the Capitol under attack on January 6. He was deeply saddened by the assault on our democracy. We all should be. Today I am forced to wonder, will we step up to defend our nation as John did?"
2021-06-23 17:43:45+00:00,"John joined the Navy as soon as he graduated from high school during World War II, and then rejoined the Marine Corps when the U.S. entered the Korean War. He did this at risk to his life, health, and career. But of course he prioritized defending the nation above all else."
2021-06-23 17:43:45+00:00,"As I entered public life, what impressed me most about John was his obvious belief that country and character count above all else. He was a Republican and I am a Democrat—but that never mattered. He never hesitated to prioritize his country over the orthodoxy of the day."
2021-06-23 17:43:45+00:00,"Long before I knew John Warner the patriotic public servant, I was honored to consider John a friend. It was only upon coming to the Senate—four years after he retired—that I came to fully understand the mark he left on the Senate, his beloved Commonwealth, and his country."
2021-06-23 17:43:44+00:00,"Today I was deeply honored to be able to share some of my thoughts at my dear friend John Warner's funeral—and I'd like to share some of them here as well, in memory of a man who truly exemplified love of country and character:"
2021-06-23 14:34:26+00:00,"There must be a thorough review of all Tier 1 Group contracts and stronger State Department oversight of U.S. defense services provided to foreign nations—especially ones with problematic human rights records like Saudi Arabia, to ensure something like this never happens again."
2021-06-23 14:34:26+00:00,"These reports confirm what I feared to be true when I pressed Trump’s DOD nominee and Tier 1 board member Louis Bremer on this disturbing subject last year: Saudi nationals responsible for assassinating Mr. Khashoggi were trained by Tier 1 Group, a U.S. private security company."
2021-06-22 22:37:59+00:00,"So what's next? We have to pass voting rights. I'm going to do everything I can, and we might need to get creative—but we are not accepting failure on this existential issue. The burden is on Democrats' shoulders now, and we're going to move forward and find solutions."
2021-06-22 22:36:30+00:00,"Republicans have filibustered the January 6th commission. Equal pay. Now voting rights. On ALL these policies that matter to the American people, they are determined to block us. But we're the majority—and we need to act like it."
2021-06-22 22:27:26+00:00,"If Republicans won’t protect our democracy—after an attack on the Capitol, after state legislatures blatantly try to take voting rights away from Americans—Democrats have to. Period."

Let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap—if we do not give up!"
2021-06-17 16:31:56+00:00,The 18-year-old Iraq War authorization is obsolete. The Government of Iraq is now a partner—not an enemy—so the House’s vote to repeal it is both welcome and overdue. Time for the Senate to follow suit and put the 2002 AUMF to rest before a future president wreaks havoc with it.
2021-06-17 15:13:08+00:00,"6 years ago, a white supremacist shooter killed 9 people gathered in prayer in Charleston. There is deep heartache in such violence being committed in a place of worship.

2021-06-17 14:25:49+00:00,Good news. Now can we finally focus on making the ACA better instead of fighting off GOP efforts to strip health care from millions? https://t.co/HNIZLhzcDd
2021-06-17 01:37:06+00:00,"We have an immense and existential burden to protect our democracy and people’s ability to participate. I care deeply about this as a civil rights attorney, a Senator, and an American, and I am not willing to accept failure as a possibility."
2021-06-17 01:37:05+00:00,It is my hope that we will get a comprehensive voting rights bill—with all 50 Democrats on board—on the Senate floor for a vote in the coming weeks.
2021-06-17 01:37:05+00:00,"While states like Virginia are making incredible progress on protecting voting rights, Congress has a significant role to play—as we did in the 1960s with the VRA—in stopping states from interfering with people’s ability to choose their leaders."
2021-06-17 01:37:05+00:00,It is absolutely imperative—and made even more dramatically so by the attack on our democracy on January 6—that we protect the voting rights of the American people. My thoughts right now:
2021-06-16 15:45:24+00:00,"Key takeaway from today's Biden-Putin summit—I'm so glad we have a President who doesn’t cozy up to Putin's authoritarianism.

Trump would cozy up to Putin and pour cold water on our allies. Biden is standing strong against Russian misbehavior and linking arms with our allies."
2021-06-16 15:38:18+00:00,Glad @POTUS is setting the right tone in his Putin meeting. We don't trust Putin and we have to stand strong against Russia’s unacceptable behavior—including human rights abuses. But we also must identify areas of common interest like nuclear diplomacy and preventing terrorism.
2021-06-16 15:27:27+00:00,Grateful to finally see action on repealing these outdated AUMFs. So much has changed since 1991 and 2002—this movement on our AUMF repeal bill represents a bipartisan recognition of this evolution and a widespread desire to not keep old war authorizations on the books.
2021-06-15 22:13:29+00:00,"Pleased that the Senate has unanimously passed a bill establishing Juneteenth as a national holiday—and glad that hundreds of thousands of federal workers, so many of whom call Virginia home, will be able to mark this meaningful day."
2021-06-15 20:57:49+00:00,"On the 9th anniversary of DACA, I'm committed to working with my Senate colleagues to provide protections for Dreamers and secure their path to citizenship. Dreamers who call Virginia and America home are a part of the fabric of our nation—let's honor and protect them."
2021-06-14 18:43:22+00:00,Great to see the Biden Administration support repeal of the 2002 AUMF—an important first step in working together on war power issues. I look forward to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee acting on the Kaine-Young bill to repeal the 2002 and 1991 AUMFs soon.

2021-05-28 16:23:23+00:00,The purpose of a commission to uncover what led to the January 6th insurrection is to prevent such an attack from ever happening again. How in the world can any member of Congress be against that?

2021-03-24 15:10:21+00:00,"More than 80 days into 2021, #EqualPayDay is a stark reminder that we must do more to secure fair pay—especially as we see the COVID-induced recession disproportionately pushing women, and particularly women of color, out of the workforce.

We must pass the Paycheck Fairness Act."
2021-03-23 21:53:08+00:00,"Just as the families affected by these horrible gun violence tragedies come from all political parties, so must the leaders who work to prevent them. We don’t have to accept this. We can change it. But we've got to put the safety of the American public over our politics—and soon."
2021-03-23 21:53:08+00:00,"Why haven't we been able to pass reforms like this before? Preventing gun violence sadly has been a partisan issue, and it's been difficult to get Republican votes. But these are not crimes that respect anybody’s politics—the victims are from red states and blue states alike."
2021-03-23 21:53:07+00:00,"It includes measures to make background checks universal, prevent access by minors, limit handgun purchases, promote responsible gun ownership, safeguard victims of domestic violence, and more. These are commonsense reforms that we know can make a difference."

2021-03-23 21:53:07+00:00,No single bill is going to prevent every single gun tragedy—but we know we can reduce crimes like this with measures like comprehensive background checks. It’s imperative that leaders in Washington take meaningful action to keep the American public safe.
2021-03-23 21:53:06+00:00,The tragedies in Atlanta last week and Boulder yesterday—two of seven mass shootings that happened in the U.S. in a seven-day span—of course make us ask: Will we finally act to reduce gun violence in the United States? Here are some of my thoughts:
2021-03-23 15:34:43+00:00,"11 years after it was signed into law by @BarackObama, the Affordable Care Act continues to save lives. 

Health care is a human right, and through continuing to protect and build upon the ACA, we've got to reach universal coverage and make sure no one is left behind."
2021-03-23 13:38:15+00:00,My heart breaks for the families who are mourning in Boulder. For the lives taken too soon. It breaks for the seven children left behind by Officer Eric Talley. And it breaks for our country as we reckon with more senseless gun violence. Enough is enough.
2021-03-22 17:49:34+00:00,"Virginia’s neighbors in D.C. deserve representation just like every other American.

2021-03-04 18:16:07+00:00,"In my conversations with health workers, it's clear that this crisis is going to have a significant impact on their lives for a long time.

2021-01-08 16:06:08+00:00,"I'm sending my deepest condolences to the family of Virginian and Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who has tragically passed away in the line of duty. I will be praying for his loved ones. I'm profoundly grateful to all who put their lives on the line to protect others."

2021-01-07 15:31:46+00:00,"America needs to help the Biden/Harris Administration repair the damage and exit a painful chapter, sadder but wiser, rebuilding a nation committed to eternal American values."
2021-01-07 15:31:45+00:00,"Law enforcement officials should investigate and, if warranted, punish insurrectionists. That includes citizen Trump, who loses all immunity on January 20th."
2021-01-07 15:31:45+00:00,Congress must also dig into the awful lack of security yesterday—praising those who performed heroically and holding accountable those who allowed the second attack on the Capitol in US history.
2021-01-07 15:31:45+00:00,"The sun is up on a new day. But there must be accountability for yesterday:

The Cabinet should invoke the 25th Amendment against Trump. If he wants to challenge, Congress should vote him out.

Congress should inform Trump that he is not welcome at the inauguration."
2021-01-07 13:45:15+00:00,"What took 34 minutes in 2017 took more than 14 hours in 2021—because, goaded by the President and abetted by some of my fellow Senators, right-wing insurrectionists stormed the Capitol in support of an effort to overturn the election results and install an unelected government."
2021-01-07 13:31:24+00:00,"In today's very early hours, we certified the Electoral College results, making official what we have known since November: that at noon on January 20th, President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris will lead our nation to a healthier, fairer, more prosperous future. https://t.co/xQwSWqNjW5"
2021-01-07 02:23:10+00:00,"But more importantly—as the body that acted together to guarantee Americans the right to vote—if we object, we will become the agent of one of the most massive disenfranchisements in the history of this country. The United States Senate cannot and must not allow that to happen."
2021-01-07 02:23:09+00:00,"If we object to these electoral results, we’re saying to states: No matter how safe and secure your elections are, we’ll gladly overturn them if we don't like the results."
2021-01-07 02:23:09+00:00,"After John Lewis was savagely beaten on Bloody Sunday, the US Senate came together to pass the Voting Rights Act.

We should be coming together today—after more violence—to affirm the votes cast in November. Instead we’re contemplating an unprecedented act of disenfranchisement."
2021-01-07 02:23:09+00:00,Tonight I spoke on the Senate floor about exactly what objecting to these electoral results means for our country:
2021-01-06 23:32:42+00:00,"Not since the Burning of Washington by the British during the War of 1812 has the Capitol been attacked. The violence we saw today was an anti-American, anti-democratic assault on our nation. All must condemn it in the strongest of terms."
2021-01-06 21:43:18+00:00,"My staff and I are safe right now—following the instructions of Capitol Police and praying for the safety of Capitol workers, members of the press, and all here in Washington today. This violence must end now."
2021-01-06 17:22:59+00:00,"To any of my Senate colleagues looking to overturn state electoral results and undermine our democracy today: I hope you’ll take a look in the mirror and consider how you want to be remembered in our history books.

Don’t sell your soul to join a toddler in his tantrum."
2021-01-06 17:06:13+00:00,"The American public is telling us loud and clear that we need bold action to get out of the disaster that was 2020. Trump's horrible mismanagement of the pandemic, economic devastation, racial injustice—these challenges are crying out for solutions, and we've got to deliver. https://t.co/fWRHWK4FDq"
2021-01-06 16:48:05+00:00,"Congratulations to Senator-elect @ReverendWarnock! 

From the pulpit of the Ebenezer Baptist Church where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. preached, to the US Capitol as Georgia’s first African American Senator—Georgians and Americans are blessed to have Dr. Warnock as a leader."
2021-01-05 18:02:12+00:00,"Yes, Donald Trump is flagrantly attempting to subvert the will of the people.

But whether a few spineless lemmings follow him off that cliff tomorrow or not, his temper tantrum is not going to make a difference.

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will assume office in 15 days."
2021-01-05 13:03:46+00:00,"HD-2 includes parts of Prince William County and Stafford County, and HD-90 includes parts of Norfolk and Virginia Beach. If you’re not sure whether you’re registered to vote in those districts, give the @vademocrats voter hotline a call at 844-4VA-VOTE."
2021-01-05 13:03:46+00:00,"Virginians, if you’re registered in the 2nd or 90th districts, today is Election Day! Make sure to go vote for our great Democrats @CandiKingForHD2 and @AWGNorfolk—polls are open until 7:00 PM, and you can vote at your usual polling place. Find it here: https://t.co/UqBifNAUCb"

2021-01-04 02:29:52+00:00,"The peaceful transition of power in the United States has been unbroken since the Constitution was ratified in 1787, and it's not going to stop this year. I look forward to celebrating Joe Biden's inauguration in 17 days."
2021-01-04 01:05:35+00:00,"Trump is trying to overthrow our democracy. To my colleagues tempted to go along: Don’t let your ambition/fear dwarf your integrity!

Joe Biden will be sworn in as President on 1/20/21."
2021-01-03 19:05:04+00:00,Senators of both parties must stand up together on January 6th to overwhelmingly defeat the overthrow attempt and then repair the damage done to the Senate and nation.
2021-01-03 19:05:03+00:00,"Your challenge is hypocritical—you voted against impeachment, saying “let the people decide,” but are now attempting to void their decision."
2021-01-03 19:05:03+00:00,Your challenge is elitist—you assert that your preference must be respected while state results and voter preferences must be ignored.
2021-01-03 19:05:03+00:00,Your challenge is discriminatory—you are attempting a massive disenfranchisement of select voters in select states that voted for the Biden/Harris ticket.
2021-01-03 19:05:03+00:00,Your challenge is dangerous—you are attempting to overthrow the government of the United States.
2021-01-03 19:05:03+00:00,To Senators attempting to overturn state electoral results in states that voted for Biden/Harris:
