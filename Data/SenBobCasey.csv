2021-02-14 00:53:36+00:00,The former President attacked the foundational principles of our democracy and the peaceful transfer of power. He violated his oath of office and he committed a high crime against our Constitution.
2021-02-14 00:53:35+00:00,"He endangered the lives of countless Congressional staffers and employees, members of the press and members of Congress. He put a target on the back of his own Vice President and his Vice President’s family. And he has shown no remorse for any of it."
2021-02-14 00:53:35+00:00,"He did not merely endanger another branch of government and the presidential line of succession. His actions led to at least five deaths, injuries to nearly 140 members of law enforcement and untold collateral damage resulting from the carnage of that day."
2021-02-14 00:53:35+00:00,"“[I]f you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.” The former President led his supporters to a breaking point and as he had predicted in the past—it was “very bad, very bad.”"
2021-02-14 00:53:34+00:00,"There's no way that a reasonable person could dispute that the former President knew exactly what he was doing by perpetuating the “Big Lie,” summoning his crowd of insurrectionists on January 6 and telling them:"
2021-02-14 00:53:34+00:00,"It was about a President who once bragged: “I have the tough people [supporting me], but they don’t play it tough until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad.”"
2021-02-14 00:53:33+00:00,It was about a President who regularly condoned or encouraged violence at political rallies against protestors and members of the press.
2021-02-14 00:53:33+00:00,This case was not merely about the former President’s speech on January 6. This was about a pattern of conduct. It was about the former President’s autocratic leadership and calls for political violence throughout his presidency.
2021-02-14 00:53:33+00:00,And he directed them to the Capitol to prevent Congress from conducting its constitutional obligation to count the presidential electoral votes.
2021-02-14 00:53:32+00:00,"After repeatedly failing to overturn the election, the former President summoned his mob of insurrectionists to Washington, D.C. on January 6, 2021 for one more attack on American democracy. He invited them. He incited them."
2021-02-14 00:53:32+00:00,"After losing in federal and state courts, he then tried to pressure state and local elections officials to overturn the election, and even attempted to pressure his Vice President to violate the Vice President’s Constitutional duty."
2021-02-14 00:53:32+00:00,This lie was roundly dismissed by more than 60 judges across the Nation—including in Pennsylvania.
2021-02-14 00:53:31+00:00,"For months after the election, we all witnessed the former President’s “Big Lie” when he repeatedly claimed—without any evidence—that the 2020 general election was stolen from him."
2021-02-13 14:57:31+00:00,"Impeachment is about protection, not punishment. https://t.co/0XHcJYucVO"
2021-02-13 14:49:24+00:00,"As we enter the final stages of the trial, my thoughts on the defense’s argument, fight song, and the most chilling evidence I’ve seen: https://t.co/Yf06qKcl2x"
2021-02-11 19:15:05+00:00,"With increased support, 2.1.1. can help all Americans looking for assistance with food and nutrition, housing, employment, education, child care, veteran’s services, health care, addiction prevention and rehabilitation, disability supports, mental health treatment and much more."
2021-02-11 19:15:05+00:00,"To support American families, we need to support 2.1.1. and make it available 24/7 to every phone in America. My bill, the Human-Services Emergency Logistics Program Act, will ensure states have the funding and support they need for reliable, accurate 2.1.1. systems."
2021-02-11 19:15:05+00:00,"Today, on National 2.1.1. Day, we recognize the importance of 2.1.1. systems and their ability to link Americans to free, multilingual and confidential information and critical human-services. During this pandemic, the 2.1.1. system is needed more than ever."
2021-02-11 17:02:22+00:00,"Day two of the impeachment trial began the House Managers’ presentations. The House’s record is substantial and emotional—to a certain extent, we all had to relive part of that day. Today we'll keep learning more and we'll make sure that this evidence is recorded for history. https://t.co/LmfxfelfOZ"
2021-02-10 21:11:30+00:00,I commend the Biden Administration for putting in place sanctions following the coup in Burma.  The military’s attacks on human rights and subversion of democracy is unacceptable.
2021-02-10 15:31:27+00:00,"According to research done by @CAPAction, the American Rescue Plan has BROAD bipartisan support, including 91% of Dems, 69% of Independents and 53% of Republicans. It's time for GOP representatives to get on board with their constituents, and for Congress to pass @POTUS's plan."
2021-02-10 15:31:27+00:00,"As we steer our Nation out of this pandemic, President Biden can't do it alone. If we want to slow the spread, open our economy and keep people alive, Congress must pass the American Rescue Plan. GOP, it's time to get on board."
2021-02-10 15:31:27+00:00,"President Biden has made critical strides, but we can't be anything less than bold. His American Rescue Plan is a historic legislative package designed to change the course of the pandemic, give families and businesses a bridge to an economic recovery and advance racial equity."
2021-02-10 15:31:26+00:00,"Under President Biden’s direction, @USDA is increasing P-EBT benefits and will look to provide extra SNAP benefits to the lowest-income households, and @FEMA has provided more than $1.7 billion in assistance to 27 states to bolster the vaccination process—with more to come."
2021-02-10 15:31:26+00:00,"Following his promise to address racial disparities, President Biden is launching a #NEW plan to deliver a million vaccines a week to providers in minority communities that have been hit hardest by the pandemic. https://t.co/WsqVjtBUgB"
2021-02-10 15:31:26+00:00,"President Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to ramp up work on badly needed equipment and materials. Additionally, the Administration is deploying over 1,000 troops and military medical personnel to aid state vaccination efforts. https://t.co/lwxMdYMPN6"
2021-02-10 15:31:25+00:00,"The Biden Administration secured the correct equipment to extract an extra dose of vaccine from every Pfizer vial, and already increased vaccine supply to states, Tribes and territories by 20 percent (@Covid19WarRoom)."
2021-02-10 15:31:25+00:00,"On Day 1, President Biden unveiled a national vaccination strategy that includes federal partnerships for federally-funded community vaccination centers across the country and mobile vaccination clinics for hard-to-reach communities. https://t.co/R4uBteAX2u"
2021-02-10 15:31:24+00:00,"Already, President Biden has signed orders to mandate mask-wearing on transit, accelerate the development of treatments, provide targeted care to long-term care facilities, expand access to care, facilitate data-sharing &amp; deploy National Guard to assist states."
2021-02-10 15:31:24+00:00,"THREAD 🧵 Despite inheriting a botched response to a public health and economic crisis, President Biden has already taken decisive action to fight this virus and build our economy back better than even before COVID-19 hit. Let's take a look ⬇️"
2021-02-10 02:32:57+00:00,My thoughts on the first day of former President Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial: you can’t have justice without accountability. https://t.co/aFLriYa792
2021-02-09 17:19:43+00:00,She is a leader who has worked to save lives during the COVID-19 pandemic and improve the health and wellbeing of Pennsylvanians. I’m grateful for her willingness to continue her public service at such a critical time for our Nation.
2021-02-09 17:19:43+00:00,"From her time as a nationally-renowned physician to her work as Pennsylvania’s Secretary of Health, Dr. Levine has established a track record of results that will serve our Nation well in this important role."
2021-02-09 17:19:43+00:00,Dr. Levine is exactly the kind of crisis-tested leader our Nation needs at HHS during this difficult time.
2021-02-09 17:19:43+00:00,"Today, I had the opportunity to meet with Dr. Rachel Levine about her historic nomination to be the Assistant Secretary for Health at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)."

2021-02-07 17:01:43+00:00,I am saddened to hear of Susan Bayh’s passing. My thoughts are with former Senator Bayh and their family during this difficult time.
2021-02-05 21:51:22+00:00,Today's jobs report underscores the need to act on COVID-19 relief. We cannot delay @POTUS's American Rescue Plan. We need to act swiftly to deliver immediate relief to American families &amp; small businesses — and that's exactly what this plan will do.
2021-02-05 21:08:48+00:00,Workers should not be forced to make the impossible choice between earning a paycheck and taking care of themselves or their family. I'm proud to join @rosadelauro and @gillibrandny to support the #FAMILYAct. @NPWF
2021-02-05 18:14:40+00:00,"The plan released by President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris is a substantial down payment on ""Build Back Better"". Our Nation is in crisis and we need to come together to put this plan on @POTUS's desk so he can sign it into law. https://t.co/4cseyps766"
2021-02-05 01:03:33+00:00,"By halting the previous Administration’s decision to remove the U.S. European Command and U.S. Africa Command headquarters from Germany, President Biden is acting decisively to reinforce our Nation’s steadfast commitment to the NATO alliance. https://t.co/frGRdagq4c"

2021-02-04 22:16:45+00:00,I’m concerned by the Indian government’s decision to cut off internet access to those protesting in Delhi. This kind of tactic violates the basic norms of a democracy and should be immediately reversed. https://t.co/zjmShNJYuM

2021-02-04 19:53:00+00:00,"I commend the Biden Administration for taking this step. The Saudi campaign in Yemen has bombarded civilian targets, contributed to one of the worst famines in the world and fueled instability in the Middle East. It’s a human rights atrocity that the U.S. should have no part in."
