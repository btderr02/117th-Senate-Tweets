2022-02-28 13:37:10+00:00,"It’s a start, but too many Russian banks are not effectively sanctioned. Secondary sanctions would force the world to decide between doing business with Russia or the U.S. by blocking from our economy any foreign bank that chooses to continue doing business with Russia."
2022-02-28 13:37:10+00:00,Who would have thought the Europeans would be the ones leading the way on imposing tougher sanctions on Russia? That’s exactly what happened over the weekend when they decided to limit Russia’s access to SWIFT.

2022-02-24 21:50:58+00:00,That’s why the U.S. should impose crippling sanctions on Russia’s oil and gas sector and Iran-style secondary sanctions on Russian banks that force the world to choose between doing business with Russia or the United States.
2022-02-24 21:50:58+00:00,"The sanctions imposed on Russian banks, while welcome, may not isolate the Russian financial system from international activity."
2022-02-24 21:50:57+00:00,"By failing to impose significant sanctions on the Russian oil and gas industry, which accounts for the majority of all Russian exports, the administration is intentionally leaving the biggest industry in Russia’s economy virtually untouched."

2022-02-23 20:47:13+00:00,"With Russian troops already invading Ukraine and preparing for a much larger assault, these sanctions are unlikely to have a deterrent effect."

2022-02-22 14:10:10+00:00,The NYET Act—which Senator Risch and I introduced last week—would make Putin feel the consequences of his invasion of Ukraine by imposing secondary sanctions on Russian financial institutions. I urge the Senate to take up this legislation as soon as we return next week.
