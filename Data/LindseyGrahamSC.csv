2023-01-02 22:42:40+00:00,"I’m glad to see Mr. Cohen, the new Israeli foreign minister, is prioritizing the US-Israel strategic relationship and supports continued humanitarian aid to #Ukraine. 

However, the idea that Israel should speak less about Russia’s criminal invasion of Ukraine is a bit unnerving."

Our amendment also takes pressure of the American taxpayer."
2022-12-22 18:53:01+00:00,"@SenWhitehouse This change in U.S. law allows the proceeds of seized assets to support Ukrainian war efforts, which is a win-win for the people of Ukraine and the American taxpayer."

2022-12-22 02:23:43+00:00,"@SenMikeLee If this bill fails because Senator Lee was not allowed a vote on extending Title 42, it will be one of the lowest points in the history of the United States Senate."
2022-12-22 02:23:22+00:00,"@SenMikeLee However, if the omnibus – which dramatically increases military spending and funds the government – fails because Democrats care more about letting Title 42 lapse than funding the federal government, so be it."
2022-12-22 02:22:51+00:00,@SenMikeLee I support the omnibus bill – even though the process is broken and it is bigger than it should be – because it meets our national security needs.
2022-12-22 02:22:10+00:00,"@SenMikeLee Republicans are willing to work with Democrats, but not at all costs."
2022-12-22 02:21:22+00:00,"It is outrageous that Senate Democrats are refusing to allow a vote on @SenMikeLee amendment to extend Title 42 expulsion authority.

2022-12-22 02:15:39+00:00,"@ZelenskyyUa They are not asking for American soldiers to do the fighting – they are asking for weapons and economic assistance so they can stay in the fight.

Ukraine’s victory is our victory. God bless Ukraine!"
2022-12-22 02:15:15+00:00,"@ZelenskyyUa To forgive and forget all the war crimes being committed by Russia in Ukraine destroys the Rule of Law as we know it, and allowing Putin to successfully take territory of a sovereign neighbor destroys world order as we know it. 
 
I am proud to support #Ukraine"
2022-12-22 02:14:19+00:00,"@ZelenskyyUa He made it clear that after almost a year of fighting, #Ukraine is ‘alive and kicking.’  They are determined to never surrender their freedom to Putin’s Russia.

It is in America’s national security interests for Putin’s Russia to be defeated in Ukraine."

State sponsor of terrorism designation is the appropriate label for Putin’s Russia."
2022-12-21 23:15:30+00:00,"The Senate voted 100-0 urging the Biden Administration to make such a designation, and I promise you it would matter."
2022-12-21 23:15:29+00:00,"Listening to the press conference with President Zelensky and President Biden, it is mind blowing to me that the Biden Administration refuses to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism under U.S. law."

2022-12-08 16:04:05+00:00,While we appreciate and celebrate the release of Brittney Griner from a Russian penal colony – held on trumped up charges and facing an excessive sentence - we must not lose focus on the fact that Paul Whelan remains unjustly held in Russia. (1/2)

2022-11-30 00:10:34+00:00,"In America, if you believe that religious liberties are worth protecting, it’s just a matter of time before we will have to revisit this issue."
2022-11-30 00:10:11+00:00,The private cause of action created in this bill is going to open up religious institutions to endless litigation. In the name of protecting one group we have now undermined the rights of another.
2022-11-30 00:09:41+00:00,"The (Mike) Lee Amendment would have clearly achieved religious liberty protection, but it was rejected. 

This was a mistake."
2022-11-30 00:08:53+00:00,The goal of the legislation was to ensure that every state had to accept the marriage laws of our sister states and at the same time protect the religious liberties of Americans and religious organizations.
2022-11-30 00:07:42+00:00,I fully understand that many Americans accept the concept of same-sex marriage. I also understand that many in this country oppose the practice for religious reasons.
2022-11-30 00:06:57+00:00,Creating a private cause of action in the statute is going to encourage a tsunami of lawsuits against religious institutions who are acting on their sincerely held convictions.
2022-11-30 00:06:07+00:00,"My chief objection to the legislation passed today in the Senate requiring recognition of same-sex marriage is the lackluster provisions in the bill protecting religious liberties.  

They are woefully inadequate to the task."

2022-11-29 20:05:00+00:00,"The combination of potential terrorist attacks, the unprecedented volume of illegal drugs, and the scourge of human trafficking is a national security and public safety nightmare.
 
When it comes to border security, the Biden Administration has a deer in headlights approach."
2022-11-29 20:04:59+00:00,"The executive director of the Air Marshal National Council stated that because of the diversion to the southern border, our skies are less safe."
2022-11-29 20:04:57+00:00,"The number of illegal crossings has turned Customs and Border Protection into a processing agency.

2022-11-16 21:01:46+00:00,"Nothing in the bill adds new protections for gay marriage, but it does, in my view, create great uncertainty about religious liberty and institutions who oppose gay marriage."
2022-11-16 21:01:45+00:00,I just voted against the “Respect for Marriage Act” that is supposed to protect gay marriage without creating risks to religious freedom and religious institutions.
2022-11-16 19:37:19+00:00,I am hopeful change will be coming to the Republican Conference to allow more collaboration and allow us to more vigorously fight for the important causes we support.

2022-11-16 03:11:59+00:00,"If President Trump continues this tone and delivers this message on a consistent basis, he will be hard to beat.  

His speech tonight, contrasting his policies and results against the Biden Administration, charts a winning path for him in the primaries and general election."
2022-11-15 23:47:05+00:00,"If the facts are borne out to be correct that Russian missiles did hit Poland and kill two people, a firm response by NATO will be absolutely indispensable for world order."
2022-11-15 23:47:04+00:00,"How NATO responds to this incident will be one of the most consequential decisions by NATO since its founding.

2022-03-11 16:58:22+00:00,"The decision to reverse course on sending the MiGs to Ukraine by the Biden Administration emboldens Putin, reduces the capability of Ukrainians to defend themselves and is a complete capitulation to threats made by Putin."
2022-03-11 16:57:48+00:00,"This decision, in coordination with other economic sanctions, should deliver a crippling blow to the Russian economy.

The sanctions outlined are woefully inadequate to deter Putin’s efforts to redraw the European map and dismember a neighboring democracy."

WATCH: https://t.co/07QiNrbWQo"
2022-02-22 15:05:00+00:00,I'll be speaking with #AmericasNewsroom this morning at 10:30 am about the latest on Ukraine-Russia.
2022-02-21 23:10:49+00:00,One of the dangerous consequences of weakness in the face of aggression.
2022-02-21 23:10:26+00:00,"Who doubts - in light of Putin’s aggression - that if they had to do it over again Ukraine never would have given up their nuclear weapons?  

I can only imagine the number of nations thinking right now that having a nuclear weapon is a good thing to have."
2022-02-21 22:34:59+00:00,"The truth of the matter is the Russian economy is smaller than that of Italy, overly dependent on oil and gas revenue, and is both internally and externally weak.  

The Russians have a pair of twos while the West has a Full House.  
 
However, it is the West that is folding."
2022-02-21 22:33:40+00:00,"It is long past time for all the Russian oligarchs – Putins’ partners in crime – to lose their yachts, luxury apartments, and their assets.  

That would be a good beginning on the long journey to push back against Putin and his misadventures."
2022-02-21 22:33:03+00:00,"I stand ready, willing and able to work with the Biden Administration to impose the most crushing sanctions possible on the Russian economy.  

The question is whether the Biden Administration has the will and determination to do so."
2022-02-21 22:32:38+00:00,"Putin is making the case for the reconstitution of the Soviet Union/Russian Empire because he believes he can get away with it.  

It’s clear that after the debacle in Afghanistan, every thuggish figure on the planet is licking their chops, including the Iranians and the Chinese."
2022-02-21 22:31:59+00:00,"If one ever had any doubt about Putin’s ambitions, today’s speech should remove all doubts."
2022-02-21 20:09:06+00:00,His decision should immediately be met with forceful sanctions to destroy the ruble and crush the Russian oil and gas sector.
2022-02-21 20:08:26+00:00,Putin’s decision to declare eastern Donetsk and Luhansk as independent regions within Ukraine is both a violation of the Minsk Agreements and a declaration of war against the people of Ukraine.
2022-02-21 20:07:51+00:00,When it comes to thugs like Putin disrupting world order and destroying democracies - enough is enough.
2022-02-21 03:00:52+00:00,"Instead of announcing crushing sanctions in detail as the President of Ukraine suggested, western powers are responding to Putin’s unending provocations making it unnervingly clear that Russia is in complete control of the outcome regarding Ukraine.  

Very dangerous."
2022-02-21 03:00:27+00:00,Putin is playing the West like a fiddle.
2022-02-19 17:13:33+00:00,"@BorisJohnson The Prime Minister is determined to make sure that the UK is in the camp of punishing Putin in the strongest possible way to ensure world order.  

We share the view that what happens in Ukraine will be a signal – for better or worse – to bad actors around the world."

2022-02-19 16:50:43+00:00,"I urge my Democratic and Republican colleagues to announce as soon as possible a sanctions regime against Russia’s aggression for the whole world to see.  

It must be tough and must be done soon."
2022-02-19 16:48:53+00:00,"I could not agree more with his assessment that we should put pre-invasion sanctions in place now so Putin can see for himself the consequences of his actions.  

Without clarity, Putin will assume weakness."
2022-02-19 16:46:55+00:00,"One of the most impressive speeches ever given at the #MSC, or anywhere, was given by President Zelensky of Ukraine.

2022-02-03 16:05:46+00:00,"Unfortunately, the Biden Administration is deaf, dumb &amp; blind when it comes to the growing radical Islamic threats emerging from Afghanistan and how a completely porous and unsecured southern border presents an opportunity for terrorism to make its way back to the United States."
2022-02-03 16:05:46+00:00,"This operation again shows why forward-deployed American forces, working with allies and partners on the ground, must continue to exist in troubled regions. It is imperative we hit them before they hit us."

2022-01-06 15:35:18+00:00,"The Biden Administration seems to be incapable of dealing with the challenges America faces, and their efforts to politicize January 6 will fall flat."
2022-01-06 15:35:05+00:00,"The Biden Presidency, one year after January 6, is in free fall not because of the attack on our Capitol, but because of failed policies and weak leadership."
2022-01-06 15:34:45+00:00,The so-called voting rights acts they are pushing are a liberal Democrat federal takeover of our election systems which constitutionally reside with the states.
2022-01-06 15:34:26+00:00,"Their brazen attempts to use January 6 to support radical election reform and changing the rules of the Senate to accomplish this goal, will not succeed."

2021-12-19 19:36:10+00:00,"The true cost of Build Back Better — $5 trillion over 10 years, not $1.75 trillion — is the wrong medicine to address the ills of the nation’s economy."
2021-12-19 19:36:10+00:00,"The CBO analysis is not fake and Build Back Better without budget gimmicks will add $3 trillion to the deficit.

2021-12-19 15:31:30+00:00,"The CBO analysis of Build Back Better definitively determined without program sunsets, it would add $3 trillion to the debt and would cost $5 trillion over 10 years, which would have a detrimental effect on our current inflation problem."
2021-12-19 15:31:29+00:00,"The CBO analysis confirmed Senator Manchin’s worst fears about Build Back Better. He has always stated that he will not support a bill full of gimmicks, a bill that added to the debt or a bill that made inflation worse."

2021-12-14 21:41:20+00:00,It will not work because Americans and honorable people around the world will continue to call on the Administration to fulfill its commitment to help those who helped us in difficult times.
2021-12-14 21:41:20+00:00,"If we abandon those who fought bravely along our side against radical Islam, who will help us in the future?

2021-12-14 21:41:20+00:00,Expressing concern about Americans and our Afghan allies living in fear of the Afghan Taliban is not the same as tracking Americans abroad – helping those we left behind is the only action that a nation who believes in honor can take.

2021-06-24 19:19:54+00:00,Mr. Chipman’s record on lawful and responsible gun ownership is horrible. His philosophy reduces the ability of lawful gun owners to protect themselves and their families.

2021-06-23 21:01:19+00:00,"Unless there’s an emphasis on prosecution and supporting the police more aggressively with funding and resources, the crime wave will continue."
2021-06-23 21:01:19+00:00,"What is missing in this plan is an emphasis on prosecuting people, stopping crazy bail reform where people get out within hours of being detained, and showing more support for police rather than defunding the police."
2021-06-23 21:01:18+00:00,"The problem with President Biden’s five point plan is it doesn’t address the root causes of the surge in violence in America.

2021-06-22 22:11:13+00:00,This bill institutes ballot harvesting – an insane idea – for the nation at large. It does away with voter ID requirements and takes away from states the ability to draw congressional districts based on redistricting.
2021-06-22 22:11:13+00:00,S.1 was written by liberal Democrats for liberal Democrats to gain control over our nation’s election process.
2021-06-22 20:17:48+00:00,"Morgan is dead right – for the State Department not to criticize the Iranian election is beyond mystifying. When it comes to Iran, the Biden Administration clearly has a blind spot."
2021-06-22 15:24:34+00:00,"I believe that this decision by the Biden Administration to withdraw all forces and not stay engaged with Pakistan is a major disaster in the making, even worse than the blunder in Iraq."
2021-06-22 15:24:33+00:00,How do we expect our withdrawal from Afghanistan to be effective without coordinating with Pakistan? Clearly the Biden Administration believes that our problems in Afghanistan are behind us.

2021-06-21 19:47:16+00:00,"Human smugglers are coming right up to the U.S. border with impunity. Each day the problem grows worse. Each day the Biden Administration becomes more hapless.

2021-06-16 18:14:33+00:00,China will never open up their lab to international scientific examination until the world punishes China through concrete steps that make it so hard for China to avoid cooperating.
2021-06-16 18:14:32+00:00,"Again, President Biden doesn’t understand China. They could care less about what the world believes regarding their image. They care about the bottom line, which is protecting their self-interests."
2021-06-16 18:14:32+00:00,"When asked about what efforts he would take to make sure China cooperated with an investigation regarding the origin of the coronavirus, President Biden reinforced the idea that China wants to be considered a normal country &amp; they’re worried about their reputation with the world."

2021-06-16 17:57:47+00:00,"Putin could care less about how the world views his efforts to silence dissidents at home and abroad. Again, quite frankly, I think he enjoys the reputation of being someone you don’t want to cross. Very dangerous observations by President Biden regarding Putin."
2021-06-16 17:57:46+00:00,Equally disturbing was the statement by President Biden telling Putin that if harm came to dissident Alexei Navalny that it would hurt Putin’s standing with the rest of the world. Again – I believe President Biden has miscalculated who he is dealing with.
2021-06-16 17:57:46+00:00,"Also, I believe Russia is proud of their efforts in interfering in our elections and will not stop until they’re made to do so."
2021-06-16 17:57:46+00:00,"It is clear to me that Putin could care less about how he’s viewed by others and, quite frankly, would enjoy the reputation of being able to successfully interfere in the internal matters of other countries."
2021-06-16 17:57:46+00:00,It is very disturbing to hear President Biden suggest that it would hurt Putin’s standing if people throughout the world believed he interfered in our election or the elections of other nations.

So sad and dangerous."
2021-06-10 14:53:23+00:00,In my view there is still time to change course and commit to a residual force of several thousand US troops to prevent the collapse of Afghanistan and prevent the rise of radical Islamist groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda.

2021-02-13 21:40:30+00:00,"It was never the goal of the House to find out what happened on January 6 and then assign blame.  

They were assigning complete and total blame to President Trump regardless."

No witnesses.  

No testimony."
