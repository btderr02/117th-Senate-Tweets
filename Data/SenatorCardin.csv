His service will never be forgotten. All those responsible for this tragedy must be held accountable."
2021-01-07 21:42:27+00:00,We cannot wait 13 days. President Trump must resign or be removed from office quickly - either through the 25th Amendment or by impeachment - before he does even more damage to our nation. https://t.co/2L9CxOBaSR
2021-01-06 22:42:54+00:00,This violent behavior and blatant disregard of the law can never be normalized in the United States of America. Never.
2021-01-06 20:39:36+00:00,The Republican enablers who encouraged @POTUS and this insurrection must actively work to calm the crowds and restore order. Words matter and the incendiary language used recently has run counter to the truth and our Constitution.
2021-01-06 20:09:45+00:00,"Pouring the gasoline, lighting the match and then praising the firefighters. Really quite unfathomable that this chaos was instigated - encouraged - by the President of the United States. 
@POTUS needs to stop this now. His volatile words started it and he must end it peacefully."
2021-01-06 16:24:59+00:00,Our job in Congress today is to fulfill our constitutional duty and tally the electoral count. It is not Congress’ role to overturn the choice of American voters. The courts and more than 155 million voters have decided the outcome. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won the election.
2021-01-05 21:23:14+00:00,I’m looking forward to working with the Biden-Harris administration to raise the score for all #ChesBay health indicators and prioritize our waterways.
2021-01-05 21:20:02+00:00,"Challenges this year, especially under the Trump admin, threatened work to improve #ChesBay. But strides in reducing pollution and restoring the oyster population in this @ChesapeakeBay report give me hope that we can move in the right direction."
