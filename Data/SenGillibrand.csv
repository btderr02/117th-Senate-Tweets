2022-12-30 20:12:56+00:00,"This year, @JoeBiden signed two of my bills protecting survivors of sexual assault and harassment into law — the #SpeakOutAct and the #EndForcedArbitration Act. We're sending a message loud and clear: Survivors will no longer be silenced. https://t.co/CcSnQICwCj"
2022-12-29 20:02:39+00:00,"Even if it takes nearly a decade of hard work, the most important fights will always be worth it. So despite all the hurdles we faced, I refused to back down from the fight to reform our military justice system — and this year, we finally won. https://t.co/OJrlwGPeCP"
2022-12-28 19:18:30+00:00,"Nyasia Pryear-Yard was just 17 when she was killed by a stray bullet.

2022-11-01 22:26:14+00:00,"Ask who benefits if they don't vote. Remind them that their vote ALWAYS matters. Offer to help them find out where and when they can vote, or even to join them at the polls!"
2022-11-01 22:26:14+00:00,"If a friend shares something that looks like misinformation, ask where they found it. Then redirect them to a reliable source, like https://t.co/PHRsglTlqF or your state board of elections. Be kind and keep it short, don't try to overwhelm them by sending multiple corrections."
