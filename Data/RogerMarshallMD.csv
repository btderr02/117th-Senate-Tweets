2022-03-02 19:10:55+00:00,"Most absurdly, in late Jan, the CDC issued guidance that allows COVID positive health care workers to return to work, even if they are still testing positive. These examples show just how flawed the science is behind the CMS vaccine mandate."
2022-03-02 19:09:34+00:00,Mountains of evidence shows those who achieved immunity through natural infection – many of them being our frontline health care heroes – are highly protected against reinfection.
