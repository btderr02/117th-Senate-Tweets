2021-01-29 21:10:57+00:00,"Yesterday, I joined @SenDanSullivan and 24 of our Senate colleagues in sending a letter to @POTUS asking for a meeting to discuss our deep concerns about his admin’s recent EO's targeting the domestic energy sector and the thousands of good-paying American jobs it supports."
2021-01-29 20:42:39+00:00,"I look forward to the day when we can once again come together and defend the sanctity of life in person, but until then, I want to say thank you to all of the #MarchforLife participants this week as they stand for life virtually. Your efforts are so needed. https://t.co/IkFYwzMaQE"
2021-01-28 22:54:02+00:00,"To take away a child’s life because of his or her chromosome count is unthinkable and I am proud to take a stand today on behalf of those who cannot. As we mark the annual #MarchforLife, we must continue to affirm the sanctity of life."
2021-01-28 22:54:02+00:00,"Today, I am introducing a bill alongside my colleagues to prohibit abortions that are sought because of a Down syndrome diagnosis—something that should already be law. All children should be given the chance at life and our friends in the Down syndrome community are no exception."
2021-01-28 21:13:17+00:00,We saw what happened when we cut defense spending: Readiness plummeted. We lost capable civilian and military talent. Modernization slowed to a halt. @POTUS needs to make sure our troops have the resources they need to defend our nation. https://t.co/eRAoR9jnxk
2021-01-27 23:05:49+00:00,"The PAIN Act would ban abortions when a baby can feel pain &amp; remove us from a list that includes China &amp; North Korea—countries notorious for human rights violations. We must continue to protect the sanctity of life, especially with this admin’s efforts to undo our progress."
2021-01-27 23:05:48+00:00,"By at least 20 weeks of age, babies can feel pain. Tragically, the U.S. is one of only seven countries that permits abortion after this point. 

To challenge that, I joined @LindseyGrahamSC and our Senate colleagues in reintroducing the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act."
2021-01-26 21:40:20+00:00,"Given that the penalty for impeachment shall be removal from office, my reading of the Constitution leads me to believe that the Founders did not intend for us to impeach former federal office holders. I agree with @RandPaul that it's not constitutional to try a former president."
2021-01-26 21:40:20+00:00,"The question I face today is also clear: Article II, Section IV reads, ‘The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.’"
2021-01-26 21:40:20+00:00,"Today – just as I did on January 6 – I look to the Constitution on how to guide my votes. Article II, Section I clearly stated that there were only two things I was permitted to do under the Constitution: ensure the electors are properly certified and count the electoral votes."
2021-01-26 15:34:17+00:00,"The greatest threats to our national security come from China and Russia. That hasn’t changed just because our president has.
 
That's why it's vital we invest in a strong military. This is my priority -- President Biden should fight for this too.

2021-01-26 00:08:46+00:00,"Worse, without holding China accountable for the theft, it risks the future of American technology companies. No longer. I'm introducing the PAID Act to send a clear message to China: there will be consequences for theft of U.S. intellectual property.⬇️

https://t.co/HVkmeBzxvb"
2021-01-26 00:08:45+00:00,"The Chinese Communist Party has a long history of challenging the US in all areas– military, economy– but also in stealing what they can't build themselves. Allowing Chinese companies to continue taking American-patented wireless technology without paying the royalties is wrong."
2021-01-23 16:22:00+00:00,"Yesterday, as we marked National Sanctity of Human Life Day, we took a moment to honor the countless precious lives taken in the name of abortion. Despite the policies of this current administration, I will continue my fight in Congress to give a voice to the voiceless."
2021-01-22 20:46:49+00:00,"I’m glad the Capitol Police and Guard are working together to keep the complex safe and to make sure this doesn’t happen again.
 
To all Guardsmen in DC: You are appreciated. You are welcome. We are very, very grateful. You will always have a place to rest here – no matter what."
2021-01-22 20:46:30+00:00,"I was shocked and angry when I heard that the National Guard – who are here protecting our Capitol – were made to feel unwelcome.
 
I’ve been asking for answers as to how this was allowed to happen.

2021-01-22 18:44:25+00:00,"As the lead Republican on @SASCGOP, I look forward to working with Austin to continue implementation of the 2018 National Defense Strategy and position the Department to confront threats from China, Russia and other rogue nations and terrorist organizations that would do us harm."
2021-01-22 18:43:20+00:00,"Today’s vote to confirm Austin as Secretary of Defense sends a strong signal to all Americans, to our allies and partners, and, most significantly, to our potential adversaries that Congress is committed to strengthening national security."
2021-01-22 18:42:52+00:00,Today the Senate voted 93-2 to confirm Lloyd Austin as Secretary of Defense.
2021-01-22 14:36:22+00:00,"My prayers are with the family, friends, and fellow soldiers of Staff Sgt. Timothy Luke Manchester of Austin, Texas, who died in Kuwait in a non-combat related incident. We will remember and honor his service."
2021-01-21 22:46:28+00:00,I’m grateful for his commitment to strong civil-military relations and appreciate that he will focus intently on the serious threats facing our nation right now—especially China and Russia.
2021-01-21 22:46:22+00:00,"After this week’s nomination hearing, I am very confident Lloyd Austin will be a strong, capable civilian leader for the Pentagon at this critical time."
2021-01-21 22:45:56+00:00,"I’ve always said it’s critical to have Senate-confirmed leadership in place at the Pentagon, and I look forward to voting with my Senate colleagues to confirm Austin as soon as we can."
2021-01-21 20:50:26+00:00,"This is disheartening for the future of American energy independence, but I will not stop fighting for legislation and other policies that keep energy costs down and further our energy and national security."
2021-01-21 20:50:26+00:00,"I am sad to see this decision to continue the failed Obama-era legacy of denying tens of thousands of Americans good, well-paying jobs at the expense of satisfying liberal, “Green New Deal” inspired interest groups."
2021-01-21 20:50:26+00:00,The Keystone XL pipeline would create thousands of jobs in Oklahoma and throughout the nation and @POTUS'  disappointing choice to revoke this permit will harm the nation’s tremendous progress toward energy independence.
2021-01-21 17:25:35+00:00,I am disappointed by the precedent set yesterday by the Biden Administration with the executive action to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement. We shouldn’t go back to bad deals out of spite– and the Paris Climate Agreement is clearly a bad deal.
2021-01-21 17:25:34+00:00,We saw over the last four years how light touch regulations led to the United States leading the world in reducing CO2 emissions– further proof that American businesses didn’t need to endure the effects of heavy-handed environmental regulations during the Obama administration.
2021-01-21 17:25:34+00:00,"The Paris Climate Agreement was a bad deal when signed under then– VP Biden &amp; it's a mistake for President Biden to rejoin. The agreement hasn't been modified– the U.S. would be responsible for the majority of reductions &amp; leading polluters, China &amp; India, largely unaccountable."
2021-01-20 22:02:45+00:00,It was great to spend time with our very own @OKGuard at today’s presidential inauguration ceremony in our nation’s Capitol. Thank you for representing the great state of Oklahoma so well! https://t.co/HB5vIBLkrS
2021-01-20 19:05:39+00:00,"The peaceful transfer of power between U.S. presidents has been a hallmark of our democracy, for both American families at home and to all around the world, for more than two centuries. I congratulate President Biden and his family on this historic day. @POTUS"
2021-01-20 19:05:39+00:00,"Even amidst these unprecedented times, I am proud we are able to celebrate the Inauguration of Joe Biden as president today."
2021-01-20 02:54:19+00:00,"It smacks of dirty dealing, and I’m once again disgusted with the process. This isn’t over and I applaud the two commissioners who were on the right side. I will keep working with our stakeholders to file additional stays."
2021-01-20 02:53:57+00:00,"The FCC continues their disturbing process of conducting votes on the disastrous Ligado petition in the dead of night. While this one wasn’t on a weekend, it was almost worse—dropped at the last minute on the eve of the inauguration. https://t.co/Ez4JYi1DTg"
2021-01-19 23:44:36+00:00,The National Defense Strategy is just as important &amp; relevant today as it was 3 years ago. Glad to hear @LloydAustin agrees this document is on track for today’s challenges – especially since he’ll be charged w/ implementing it if confirmed as #SECDEF. https://t.co/XYTeWoR07i
2021-01-19 20:56:45+00:00,Our military’s technological advantage is eroding. @DeptofDefense – and its leadership – must tackle these issues head on if we hope to defend our way of life from those who would do us harm. Looking forward to hearing how @lloydaustin views these challenges at our hearing today. https://t.co/dRxiMbKxf1
2021-01-19 17:00:19+00:00,".@PPFA, which employs 16,000 people nationwide, already ignored these rules once—affiliates across 37 locations illegally received more than $80M in taxpayer dollars. It’s clear—Planned Parenthood does not qualify for @SBAgov's  second round of PPP loans."
2021-01-19 16:59:36+00:00,Eligibility requirements to receive the first round of PPP loans were clear: the small business could not employ more than 500 individuals across all affiliates. The recent second round of PPP loans are aimed at assisting even smaller businesses with no more than 300 employees.

2021-01-15 22:50:51+00:00,I’m pleased that we’re recognizing the contributions all Muscogee (Creek) men and women have made to our armed forces today. The USNS Muscogee Creek Nation is a fitting tribute to the generations of Muscogee (Creek) citizens who have served and sacrificed for our nation.
2021-01-15 18:30:36+00:00,"Earlier this week at a @SASCMajority hearing, I asked our witnesses why civilian control of the military is so important.
