2021-01-12 19:18:53+00:00,"International donors – including the United States – should reassess security assistance and other financial support to Uganda, taking into account events on or around the election that have undermined democracy and violated human rights and the rule of law."
2021-01-12 19:18:23+00:00,"This campaign has been marked by the worst political violence in Uganda in decades. 

Authorities have demonstrated blatant disregard for human rights &amp; constitutional freedoms through frequent attacks on political leaders, activists, journalists, &amp; ordinary citizens."
2021-01-12 19:18:00+00:00,"The violent and oppressive tactics employed by Ugandan authorities in the lead up to the January 14 general elections have, for months, eroded and undermined the credibility of Uganda’s electoral process, and I urge the government to reverse course."
2021-01-12 14:54:52+00:00,"The events at the U.S. Capitol caused many around the world to question whether the future of our democratic system is at risk.

2021-01-12 02:35:37+00:00,"I’m also concerned that the designation, which is set to go into effect on January 19, is an attempt by the Trump administration to thwart the incoming administration’s efforts to change U.S. policy toward Yemen."
2021-01-12 02:35:19+00:00,"Rather than improving conditions on the ground, the designation will further complicate efforts to end the country’s nearly six-year war and is likely to exacerbate the humanitarian crisis to the point of famine."
2021-01-12 02:35:01+00:00,Yesterday’s decision by Secretary Pompeo to designate Yemen’s Houthi movement as a foreign terrorist organization undermines U.S. interests and values in Yemen and the Gulf region.

2021-01-11 02:20:00+00:00,"There can only be reconciliation with repentance. 

The most important thing for Republicans in Congress to do is stop the lies and persuade their supporters that President-elect Biden won in a free and fair election. That's the next step for healing. https://t.co/Y3jfqQTZPJ"
2021-01-10 20:00:59+00:00,"We have two pandemics raging through this country. 

One of them is the COVID-19 pandemic, and the other is the pandemic of division and distrust. The way to deal with them is by telling people the truth.

2021-01-06 21:13:59+00:00,I never thought I would see this in our nation - a President egging on protestors and allies in the Congress to seek to overturn an election.

2021-01-06 21:13:59+00:00,I’m safe as are the senators and staff.  There were some scary and chaotic moments when the Capitol was breached by protestors and the Capitol police evacuated us from the Senate.
2021-01-06 14:50:00+00:00,"The sweeping, mass arrest of pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong is unacceptable. 

If China does not abide by international agreements it has signed, including a treaty that grants a high degree of autonomy to Hong Kong, how can other countries trust China’s word today?"
