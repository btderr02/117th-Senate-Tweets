2022-12-30 20:39:39+00:00,"Washington Democrats’ spending is unsustainable and is fueling historic inflation. When Congress returns in January, alleviating the burden of inflation on Americans and taming our mandatory spending and national debt must be top priorities.https://t.co/FO7LU16VW9"

2022-12-20 17:17:40+00:00,The Biden Administration has dealt with the crisis at our southern border with raging incompetence—our overwhelmed border communities and country at-large cannot afford their lack of attention. Title 42 must be kept in place to help stem the tide of illegal immigration.
2022-12-20 14:49:39+00:00,"We have record numbers of migrants illegally crossing the border and an alarming increase in drug trafficking, yet the Administration refuses to accept the solution sitting right in front of them: finish the wall, keep the “Remain in Mexico” policy, and keep Title 42 in place."
2022-12-16 13:27:48+00:00,"As China becomes a greater threat, working with allies like Japan is key to defending freedom and maintaining the global order.

2022-12-09 16:13:24+00:00,Nuclear energy is non-emitting and available right now.

2022-12-08 17:47:50+00:00,"China emits more CO2 than the United States, Europe, and Japan combined.

2022-01-17 21:34:46+00:00,"Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke: “Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into a friend.” Disparaging others will only deepen the rift that divides us. May we honor Dr. King's legacy by demonstrating respect, understanding, and grace for all of God's people. https://t.co/G0sK0MRgId"
2022-01-16 19:20:22+00:00,"Instead of trying to unilaterally re-write the election rules in every single state, Democrats should work with Republicans on reforms to our electoral system. Democrats current efforts are nothing more than a political play to appeal to their base. https://t.co/sdvQ8urpPh"
2022-01-16 18:25:30+00:00,"Russia is currently a gas station parading as a country—and Putin is trying to re-establish the old Soviet Union. This can’t be allowed to happen. The U.S. must work with our allies to strengthen NATO. We need a strong NATO not just for Russia, but for the emergence of China. https://t.co/8umYD9orAw"
2022-01-16 17:49:02+00:00,"Democrats are attempting a federal takeover of our elections, which were deliberately left up to the states to keep autocracy from taking hold in America. I'm working w/ a bipartisan group of colleagues on election reforms because any change to our voting laws must be bipartisan. https://t.co/cCZGufnMHz"
2022-01-16 17:20:35+00:00,"Senate Republicans are willing to work with the President on bipartisan solutions to the challenges facing Americans—fixing inflation, family security, health care, education, immigration.

-disaster at our southern border
 
POTUS needs to stop trying to transform America and work to unify the country, like he promised. https://t.co/xhrhASZC6c"
2022-01-16 16:33:56+00:00,It must be made very clear to Putin: There will be extraordinary consequences should any action be taken to invade Ukraine or overthrow its government. And these consequences must be in coordination with our allies. Shutting down Nord Stream 2 would be a good place to start. https://t.co/9782qrLYin
2022-01-13 15:31:50+00:00,"It’s absurd to claim that to 'save a democracy,' a party that represents barely half the country is entitled, entirely by itself, to trample the rules of its senior democratic institution. Legislation of consequence must be a product of bipartisan compromise to be effective. https://t.co/NVyENHdNgx"

2022-01-12 13:56:23+00:00,Eliminating the filibuster—the 60-vote threshold—makes little sense when Democrats' legislative priorities can't even get 50 votes. Efforts to abolish the filibuster seem like a solution in search of a problem—and one Democrats may soon regret very much. https://t.co/6OzyQamj6u
2022-01-11 23:46:38+00:00,"Many claim the filibuster is racist, yet I don't recall a single claim from Democrats that employing the filibuster was racist when they were in the minority. Now, with the barest of majorities, they are conveniently ignoring their own impassioned defense of the filibuster. https://t.co/hNSx99oICy"
2022-01-11 22:56:12+00:00,"The Senate is one of our vital democratic institutions, and the power given to the minority is one of its defining features. Eliminating the filibuster would give way to extremism by removing the requirement for political consensus, which is in Americans’ best interests. https://t.co/7Af2SFRXs5"
2022-01-11 22:23:35+00:00,I’ll be speaking on the Senate floor about Democrats’ radical attempts to remake our governmental institutions by eliminating the Senate filibuster. Watch live: https://t.co/YUtlCf5Kwk
2022-01-11 21:24:53+00:00,Successful businesses rely on daily information to make sound decisions—the government should follow suit for tracking COVID-19.

2022-01-11 19:38:45+00:00,"The lack of COVID tests available amid the Omicron surge is a result of the Administration's failure to build up testing capacity while infections were relatively low.

2021-12-24 17:41:04+00:00,"The United States will not standby as the Chinese Communist Party commits genocide against the Uyghurs.

2021-12-24 15:52:29+00:00,"This year, we’ve seen tragedies around the world and faced difficulties here at home. Despite it all, many have stepped up to ensure the well-being of others. It’s my hope that we find peace and comfort in those who make the world a better place. Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays!"
2021-12-20 21:16:18+00:00,"Now that it’s clear “Build Back Better” isn’t moving forward &amp; with bipartisan opposition to extending the President’s ill-crafted Child Tax Credit, the Administration has an opportunity to actually work with Republicans &amp; Democrats on lasting, fiscally-responsible family policy. https://t.co/6ePaFrYciA"

2021-12-17 16:31:48+00:00,"With record unemployment numbers well below the national average, Utah continues to lead the nation in economic vitality and job security. Kudos to the hardworking Utahns and employers in our state for their commitment to job creation and growth."

Taylor Hoover."
2021-12-16 18:45:46+00:00,The Chinese Communist Party's genocide of the Uyghur people is one of the greatest human rights atrocities of our generation.

2021-12-16 14:27:24+00:00,"Democrats' ""Build Back Better Plan"" is greatly flawed—it's bad policy and the process of crafting the bill has been equally terrible. Legislation that affects something as important as our children, and how we raise our children, must be bipartisan. https://t.co/w7s3xTAwOx"
2021-12-15 23:03:06+00:00,"This summer we lost 13 incredibly brave U.S. servicemembers—including Staff Sgt.

2021-12-15 21:59:00+00:00,"This year's NDAA, which passed the Senate today, boosts Utah's ability to help strengthen our national security.

2021-12-15 19:13:49+00:00,"Democrats have chosen to go it alone on child care, which is just one reason why their ""Build Back Better"" plan is so flawed.

2021-12-15 16:57:35+00:00,"Families, localities, and churches—not the federal government—should be in charge of what’s being taught and instilled in our young children.

2021-12-14 19:07:15+00:00,"Medicaid programs are best managed by the states. Our legislation would give states like Utah more freedom and flexibility to manage their Medicaid program, and continue to provide health coverage to those who depend on it. https://t.co/jcmHw3iOVf"

2021-12-13 18:29:52+00:00,"The CCP is tightening its grip on the people of Hong Kong—continuing its quest to roll back precious civil liberties. The court’s decision to imprison pro-democracy leaders, like Jimmy Lai, further enables the CCP and its cronies in Hong Kong to crush political dissent."

2021-12-08 22:37:18+00:00,China's military threats toward Taiwan’s sovereignty should alarm free nations around the world. An invasion of Taiwan must have severe costs. It's imperative that we partner with our allies to counter China’s aggression and strengthen policies that support Taiwan’s freedom. https://t.co/hoDHO2VH5j
2021-12-08 15:53:08+00:00,"Withholding diplomats from the Beijing Olympics will bring attention to the Chinese Communist Party’s graves human rights abuses, genocide of the Uyghurs, and threat China poses to the global order.

2021-12-07 20:39:31+00:00,"Our Olympians have trained their entire lives to compete and the burden of our foreign policies shouldn’t rest on their shoulders.

2021-12-07 19:53:17+00:00,China is trying to mollify the global community—tricking nations to think that they play by the rules. A diplomatic boycott of the Beijing @Olympics by the U.S. must spark a global discussion on the Chinese Communist Party's repressive regime &amp; shed light on the Uyghur genocide. https://t.co/aa65nUKnwp
2021-12-07 14:48:04+00:00,"The world needs to understand what’s happening in China.

2021-12-06 19:51:27+00:00,"America must not lend its credibility to the Chinese Communist Party, which represses ethnic &amp; religious minorities—committing genocide against its Uyghur citizens. @TimKaine and I applaud the President’s decision to withhold a diplomatic presence from the Beijing Olympic games. https://t.co/VapgY2MLgp"
2021-12-06 14:29:18+00:00,"When companies and politicians avert their eyes from China’s predations and slavery, they are effectively paying the cannibals to eat them last.

2021-12-03 18:58:25+00:00,Labor shortages are driving up costs on meat and produce. I frequently hear from Utah’s agriculture producers that they simply don’t have enough workers.

2021-12-02 21:08:11+00:00,"Democratic leadership is blocking a bill that would prevent goods made with Uyghur slave labor in China from being sold in the U.S. Let's be clear: they need cheap batteries for their ""Build Back Better"" agenda.
