2022-12-30 22:59:42+00:00,The Biden Admin's disastrous &amp; full-fledged war on US energy production has led to record-high energy prices &amp; energy dependence. Our country should not have to beg foreign adversaries for oil when we have reliable &amp; affordable domestic energy here at home.
2022-12-30 21:53:20+00:00,"When I visited our southern border this year, I saw the dangerous dysfunction of the Biden Admin’s wide-open border policies. ‘Border Czar’ VP Harris can spin the truth, but Americans know that the #BidenBorderCrisis is real because numbers don't lie."
2022-12-30 21:22:15+00:00,"President Biden’s dismantling of our southern border has endangered American lives everywhere. The #BidenBorderCrisis has given criminals, cartels, &amp; terrorists the green light to come into our country, exploit our border, &amp; wreak havoc on our communities."

2022-12-28 21:11:10+00:00,"We do need reform to stop the record-shattering border crisis, but Dems should call their version of immigration reform what it is: mass amnesty. Biden should be asked whether he would support “immigration reform” that doesn’t include legalization."
2022-12-28 21:11:09+00:00,"When they say “we need comprehensive immigration reform,” they mean “instead of stopping illegal immigration, let’s simply make it legal”—giving amnesty, citizenship, voting rights &amp; public benefits to those who have entered our country illegally."
2022-12-28 21:11:08+00:00,"When they say “manage the border,” they mean “let as many people into our country and resettle them in places like Tennessee as quickly and efficiently as possible.”"
