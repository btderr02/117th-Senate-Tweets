2022-12-20 18:58:20+00:00,TikTok now whines that banning their app sends “a chilling message to foreign tech.” That’s exactly what I want to do - tell #China tech they can’t spy on Americans https://t.co/jbgf6hdoXh

2022-12-20 12:01:37+00:00,Great news today for Fort Leonard Wood. I’m delighted to announce the Army has committed to spending $41 million in 2023 and another $50 million in 2024 for new housing on base. That’s 180 new homes. Our service members and their families deserve it
2022-12-20 00:27:26+00:00,"Yes, amazing coincidence"
2022-12-19 18:48:08+00:00,"And even now, whistleblowers have revealed the Biden Admin is standing up a massive censorship machine across the government, targeting American citizens"
2022-12-19 18:47:17+00:00,The FBI actively interfering in multiple  elections is the biggest threat to our constitutional democracy today
2022-12-19 18:31:02+00:00,"Remember, the FBI knew for a fact the Hunter Biden story was true. They had taken possession of the laptop a full year before @nypost ran the story"

2022-12-19 18:24:03+00:00,"In 2016, the FBI used the fake Steele dossier to spy on a presidential campaign, and then falsified evidence to a federal court to keep the spying going"
2022-12-19 17:41:53+00:00,"Big Tech interfering in elections is bad enough. The FBI doing it is far, far worse"

2022-12-15 01:14:07+00:00,Tonight the Senate unanimously passed my bill to BAN TikTok on all government devices
2022-12-14 22:46:51+00:00,Nice that Mayor Pete had time to vacation in Europe while forcing rail workers to go without sick days
2022-12-14 22:44:55+00:00,What has the Biden Administration done to prepare for the massive surge of illegals at the border - the one THEIR policies are causing? Nothing https://t.co/2EJ5882hIL
2022-12-14 01:30:59+00:00,"14,000 illegals - EVERY DAY. Courtesy of Joe Biden https://t.co/urHvns015h"
2022-12-13 23:44:11+00:00,Good advice. Let the new Republican majority negotiate a new budget - no last minute spending bill written by Dems &amp; stuffed with goodies
2022-12-13 23:38:13+00:00,Correct

2022-12-12 14:48:07+00:00,The answer is Yes

2022-12-10 00:41:20+00:00,It’s even worse than we thought
2022-12-09 19:23:04+00:00,It is hard to count the number of lies @Twitter executives told under oath to Congress
2022-12-09 17:15:09+00:00,It has been the message of corporate journalists for years
2022-12-09 13:50:40+00:00,Yes
2022-12-09 03:56:47+00:00,"Yet how many times did I hear @jack say, including to Congress, that Twitter never targeted conservatives. And how many “reporters” repeated this lie over and over and over and over"

2021-06-04 13:48:27+00:00,Anthony Fauci’s recently released emails and investigative reporting about #COVID19 origins are shocking.

2021-05-06 15:03:27+00:00,I also cite Justice Thomas’ thorough discussion of this redrafting by the courts - he cites and expands on the same line of cases I cite. You ignore all this
2021-05-06 15:02:59+00:00,"And it’s a minor point, but I don’t say the Clayton Act “established” the FTC. I say “Wilson’s legislation ... gave the FTC enforcement authority” and “set up” the FTC - as indeed the Clayton Act empowers &amp; defines FTC enforcement, which I argue helped normalize new corp order"
2021-05-06 15:02:59+00:00,"You can disagree with this interpretation, but it’s not a “factual error.” And again, there’s a lot of scholarship on this that this reviewer either doesn’t know or ignores"
2021-05-06 15:02:59+00:00,"For that reason, I conclude “the new FTC ... emerged as a project to regulate and normalize the corporate behemoths rather than dissolve them.” Here again, I am following progressive scholarship, particularly Martin Sklar, whom I cite"

2021-05-05 16:33:55+00:00,"In defense of these particular critics, they’re not historians or legal experts, they’re political commentators. That’s why engaging with the relevant historical literature and case law is so important. But thanks for reading!"
2021-05-05 16:33:55+00:00,"To such a degree that c2, which contains the “good faith” takedown provision, basically becomes obsolete. I cite a couple of cases that trace this evolution. And I also cite Justice Thomas’ superb opinion in the Malwarebytes case that sets out the analysis - worth reading"
2021-05-05 16:33:55+00:00,"As to Section 230, the @WIRED write up in particular takes me to task for allegedly getting the “good faith” provision wrong. But the reviewer doesn’t appear to have read or understood the relevant cases, which walk through the courts’ expansion of Section 230c1"
2021-05-05 16:33:55+00:00,"Even though TR gave too much ground on monopoly, the TR-Wilson battle still matters because TR remained a defender of republican political economy. Wilson abandoned it. Efforts to rein in monopoly that aren’t linked to republican ideals won’t rescue self government"
2021-05-05 16:33:55+00:00,"This new pro-corporate consensus. I take Theodore Roosevelt to task in the book for getting too comfortable w/ monopoly power himself. The corporate liberal consensus has informed our politics for decades. And no, FDR didn’t fundamentally alter the balance, as I mention in book"
2021-05-05 16:33:54+00:00,"His antitrust reforms in fact ultimately helped cement the new corporate liberal consensus, w/ a big assist from the Supreme Court. Again, there’s an extensive secondary literature on this for those who care to read. And my argument is that both left AND right basically accepted"
2021-05-05 16:33:54+00:00,"Wilson changed his rhetoric for a period in 1912, to try to contrast himself with Theodore Roosevelt. I talk about this in the book. But the conversion was mostly rhetorical, and fleeting. Wilson never became a Brandeisian"
2021-05-05 16:33:54+00:00,That’s lazy. Do the work. Take the time to understand the historical debate &amp; engage with it. I stand by my analysis of Wilson’s writings and speeches over the decades of his career. The guy was comfortable with bigness &amp; corporatism
2021-05-05 16:33:54+00:00,"I think these historians are largely correct, and I cite some of the extensive secondary literature in the book. My lefty critics, however, don’t engage with any of this historical debate or even seem aware of it. They claim that calling Wilson a corporatist is a factual “error”"
2021-05-05 16:33:53+00:00,"There is some irony here. The fiercest critics of Wilson as a corporatist come from progressive historians, who have argued for decades now that Wilson was basically okay w/ monopoly power &amp; corporate power more generally"
2021-05-05 16:33:53+00:00,"A few further thoughts on the lefty unease with history on display in the @WIRED and @newrepublic write ups of my book. These folks try to take me to task for calling Woodrow Wilson a corporatist, a position the authors appear to dislike because Wilson was a Democrat"
