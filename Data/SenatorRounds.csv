2021-05-27 19:51:08+00:00,"There are many interesting moves being made in the field of CCs. It very much is the Wild West of finance. They make new things possible, which isn’t always a good thing. They can have consequences no one expected. This field deserves a great deal of attention going forward."
2021-05-27 19:51:07+00:00,"So how does this relate to Colonial Pipeline? Bitcoins only exist as data. They can be tied to digital wallets rather than a specific person’s identity, which means people believe they can receive and spend them anonymously- perfect for secret transactions like ransoms."
2021-05-27 19:51:07+00:00,"This means that, as bitcoin gets more valuable, more people mine, mining gets harder, it takes more computations and more electricity to mine a bitcoin. Some of you may be familiar with @elonmusk recent statement about bitcoin’s carbon footprint."
2021-05-27 19:51:07+00:00,"In short, the more miners there are, the harder it is to mine bitcoins. Since the best way to mine is to simply use more computations, there is an incentive to pool as much effort into mining as possible, simply to make sure your pool has an advantage over other miners."
2021-05-27 19:51:06+00:00,"The interesting thing is that you can make it easier or harder to form new blocks if you make the nonce higher or lower. And for bitcoin, the difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks so that the rate of formation of new blocks is constant."
2021-05-27 19:51:06+00:00,"Despite the randomness, it's more like they’re getting paid a fee to maintain ledgers than mining or creating bitcoins. Miners provide proof that they’ve done work to contribute to the chain in exchange for compensation (in bitcoins), rather than making bitcoins themselves."
2021-05-27 19:51:06+00:00,"The first person to win a block gets a prize of bitcoins. Since the second step in forming a block is essentially up to chance, the most effective way to mine is simply to throw more computation at the problem, verifying as many blocks as possible as fast as possible."
2021-05-27 19:51:05+00:00,"You may ask “why not just guess 000…0001 for your hash, if the goal is to get a hash below the target nonce?” The answer: your guess is put through what is basically a randomizing equation based on several inputs, like the timestamp. Guessing your hash ahead of time is #noncense"
2021-05-27 19:51:05+00:00,"In short, mining a new bitcoin is a two-step process. First, you need to verify a block’s worth of transactions, then you need to guess a hash (a number). Your guess is compared to a target (called a nonce) and if your guess is below the nonce then you form a block."
2021-05-27 19:51:05+00:00,"Since #bitcoins are decentralized, there isn’t a government or bank to maintain the system, which means there needs to be a different way. People who verify transactions are bitcoin miners, and the process of verification is fundamental to how they make (or mine) new bitcoins."
2021-05-27 19:51:04+00:00,"These protocols revolve around cryptography (for computers, this is the use of math to code information) hence “crypto”currencies. However, someone needs to actually verify each new block in the chain to keep the system running smoothly."
2021-05-27 19:51:04+00:00,"This blockchain of transactions forms a distributed ledger that is difficult to modify and easy to verify (in theory); a ledger that is maintained collectively on a network with specific protocols to verify each new block in the chain, meaning that bitcoin exchanges are secure."
2021-05-27 19:51:03+00:00,"The software used to make new CCs exists and is publicly available, which means that developing a new CC can be done in as little as a few hours. Honestly, it looks like a return to the days when each bank printed their own notes."
2021-05-27 19:51:03+00:00,"CCs exist only in digital ledgers and wallets rather than as physical objects like dollar bills. Like all fiat currencies, they have value only because people agree they do, but CCs in general lack the backing of a government or central bank."
2021-05-27 19:51:03+00:00,"Some people decided that, if the commodity backing a currency doesn’t matter, then why should money need to be a physical object and why should you need a government (or bank) to back money? From there, some programmers started developing cryptocurrencies (CCs)."
2021-05-27 19:51:02+00:00,Some history: in the last century governments have moved away from commodity currencies (such as gold) to fiat currencies (such as Federal Reserve notes) cementing the idea that money can have value just because people agree it does.
2021-05-27 19:51:02+00:00,"Software developments, however, mean that they don’t need to bother with masks and voice modulators. They can issue a ransom and request payment with a cryptocurrency (CC) (like bitcoin) rather than exchange a briefcase full of cash."
