2022-12-22 01:41:43+00:00,I thank President Zelenskyy for speaking to Congress tonight and making the case for America to continue to support his country. An investment in Ukraine is an investment in security of our allies around the globe. https://t.co/eoTh5tYTfS
2022-12-22 01:41:41+00:00,"Ukraine, powered by the bravery of its soldiers and the strength of American arms, has made remarkable progress stopping and rolling back Russia’s invasion. We must accelerate, not curtail, our support."
2022-12-22 01:41:40+00:00,President Zelenskyy’s address to Congress was an inspiring call to action for America. We must continue to provide more aid to Ukraine to ensure that it can defeat Russia’s aggression and win this war.
2022-12-20 22:43:42+00:00,Wrapped up my 326th and final weekly #Ohio press call today. These conversations have been an excellent opportunity to update Ohioans on the work we are doing in DC and I will certainly miss touching base with the #Ohio press corps each week. https://t.co/RIUpIyWL0K
2022-12-20 21:53:35+00:00,"This beautiful addition has taken nearly 8 years to complete. My bipartisan legislation, the World War II Memorial Prayer Act, was signed into law in 2014, and I am excited to see this prayer plaque finally become a reality. https://t.co/vEofuc8dDD"

2022-12-19 22:27:36+00:00,I’m glad Chief Justice Roberts has temporarily blocked the end of Title 42 because our border agents have already lost control of the border and the admin must put policies in place to stop migrants from coming unlawfully before Title 42 is lifted.
2022-12-19 18:54:11+00:00,I was honored to join @DaytonHabitat today to continue construction of a new build for a local family. There is no better way to celebrate than giving back to the Buckeye State! https://t.co/vsbm9ejcUR
2022-12-19 18:54:06+00:00,Each year my favorite birthday gift is being able to volunteer on a Habitat for Humanity build in #Ohio.

2022-12-19 04:26:29+00:00,I am committed to keeping Ohioans safe and giving our men and women in uniform the resources they need to protect themselves. This year I fought to include a number of key priorities in the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act.
2022-12-19 00:46:10+00:00,"Jane and I want to wish our friends in the Jewish community in #Ohio and around the world a Happy Hanukkah! We also remember the miracles of this holiday, as we renew our commitment to our friends in #Israel, and to their security and safety. #HappyHanukkah https://t.co/2SG2pzcvGd"
2022-12-18 17:07:52+00:00,None of this would have been possible without my constituents in #Ohio for giving me the privilege of serving the Buckeye State.

2022-12-17 22:26:41+00:00,"I’ve strived to deliver bipartisan results through servant leadership and am proud of what our team, along with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, have been able to accomplish together. https://t.co/RQDnE0OmDp"

2022-12-17 18:57:27+00:00,I am looking forward to the president signing this important legislation into law in order to better support our men and women in uniform.
2022-12-17 18:57:26+00:00,I was pleased to have 12 of my initiatives included in the final 2023 National Defense Authorization Act. This historic funding is critical to strengthening our country’s national defense and supporting our troops all around the world.
2022-12-14 16:44:38+00:00,"Under the Obama-Biden administration, @DHSgov (with then-Deputy @SecMayorkas) increased detention space to deal with the 2014/2015 border crisis. Today’s border crisis is more than 3X worse, but the current administration is trying to cut detention spaces. This is bad policy."
2022-12-14 16:43:53+00:00,"Congress must fund increased detention space for single adults as Title 42 expires. Decreased detention space leads to poor policy decisions to release unlawful migrants, including those with criminal records,  which only empowers human smugglers and traffickers."
2022-12-12 21:45:52+00:00,"Our Border Patrol is being overrun with thousands crossing the border unlawfully. The Biden admin must end their failed policies and take action to stop unlawful migration.

2022-12-10 17:29:40+00:00,"In order to make life more affordable for working families, Congress must work together to stop excessive spending, unleash energy production, and promote pro-growth economic policies."
2022-12-10 17:29:39+00:00,"Americans are feeling the impacts this holiday season of irresponsible and excessive stimulus spending. This year, 93% of consumers are expecting inflation to impact their holiday budget."
2022-12-09 21:45:18+00:00,These issues won’t be solved by one party running over the other and imposing its will on the country. They will only be solved by us working together in good faith. https://t.co/WwJYFAxIib
2022-12-09 21:45:18+00:00,"Our country faces enormous challenges, whether it be our economy and record inflation, our national debt that is robbing future generations of Americans, the absence of any real border security and our broken immigration system, or the looming insolvency of entitlement programs."
2022-12-09 21:45:17+00:00,"It is really the only thing that forces us to work together in a bipartisan way. The result, when we find common ground, is better legislation that will stand the test of time and be sustainable for the American people."
2022-12-09 21:45:17+00:00,I hope that one of the things we can agree on is the need to uphold the #Senate as an institution and what it stands for. I strongly believe that means preserving the legislative filibuster that protects the rights of the minority in the Senate.
2022-12-09 21:45:17+00:00,"We’ve seen significant bipartisan successes when we work together – the bipartisan infrastructure law, the CHIPS Act, cybersecurity reforms, the Respect for Marriage Act and much more."
2022-12-09 21:45:16+00:00,"Our commitment was to move the ball forward, wherever possible, for our great country and the families of #Ohio. The result, when we find common ground, is better legislation that will stand the test of time and be sustainable."
2022-12-09 21:45:16+00:00,"In that speech, I talked about my interest in solving problems and working across the aisle to tackle big issues facing our country. My team and I have viewed it as a sacred trust to do all we could while we had this temporary privilege."

2022-12-05 22:31:25+00:00,A report from @NBCNews verifies that CCP sponsored hackers  stole millions in COVID-19 benefits meant to help Americans. This is just one more reason why Congress should prioritize protecting our institutions from the Chinese government. https://t.co/TjWF9I58lT
2022-12-05 22:31:15+00:00,"As I said in a March HSGAC hearing, we know that billions of $$ in COVID-19 funding has been stolen by transnational criminal orgs in countries like #China &amp; Russia, many of whom used fraudulent schemes to exploit the pandemic for their own financial gain. https://t.co/jXoNkCKV91"
2022-12-04 22:50:28+00:00,"We must work together to make life more affordable for working Americans, and I urge the Biden admin to get back to pro-growth, common-sense economic policies that were helping small businesses prior to the pandemic."
2022-12-04 22:50:28+00:00,Inflation caused by the Democrats’ reckless spending are effecting every aspect of American’s lives. This Christmas season 93% of consumers expect inflation to impact their holiday shopping budgets.

2022-12-04 16:41:36+00:00,"Congress has delivered bipartisan results to invest in American competitiveness and strengthen our communities. However, this Congress has been unable to reach agreement on one important topic: removing trade barriers &amp; strengthening trade enforcement."
2022-12-03 23:12:49+00:00,"Instead of more taxes and spending, we should work together to pursue common-sense economic policies like those Republicans put in place before the pandemic which produced low unemployment, significant job gains, and record wage growth."
2022-12-03 23:12:48+00:00,"Prices have risen 13.9% since the day @POTUS took office. For 11 consecutive months, CPI inflation has remained at a 40-year high, above 7%. The key drivers of rising CPI were the rising costs of: gas, rent, electricity, and groceries."
2022-12-03 12:52:50+00:00,Best of luck to #USA’s @USMNT as they take on the Netherlands today in round 16 of the @FIFAWorldCup!
2022-12-03 01:08:00+00:00,Congress has had almost two years to pass trade legislation and has so far come up short. That’s unacceptable. Let’s get this done.
2022-12-03 01:08:00+00:00,"Lastly, a bipartisan trade compromise should reauthorize the GSP and MTB programs which while small have major benefits for small businesses and American manufacturers. #jobs"
2022-12-03 01:07:59+00:00,That’s why a trade agreement should include my bipartisan Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0 to provide new tools to combat China's unfair trade practices to protect American jobs and support our industrial base.
2022-12-03 01:07:59+00:00,"Second, we should reauthorize Trade Adjustment Assistance to help our workers who lose their jobs to trade. It’s a shame Congress has let the program expire. But the best TAA is the one you don’t need because workers retain high-wage jobs."
2022-12-03 01:07:58+00:00,"First, we need new negotiating authority to expand opportunities for American-made exports and constrain China. That requires passing the bipartisan Trading System Preservation Act to expand trade with allies and new bilateral agreements with the UK, Taiwan, Kenya, and Ecuador."
2022-12-03 01:07:57+00:00,https://t.co/Pqbhl5SkuS
2022-12-03 01:07:57+00:00,Congress should absolutely pass a bipartisan trade package before the end of the year in order to strengthen American competitiveness and help American workers. Read about my bipartisan trade proposal with @ChrisCoons that I am urging Congress to pass in @TheHill below.

2022-12-01 20:12:36+00:00,"As #Ukraine continues to fight off Russia’s brutal assault, the U.S. cannot let up in our support. We continue to provide the tools that #Ukraine’s brave defenders need to win this war. https://t.co/HMHLWZXbTW"

2022-11-30 18:23:27+00:00,"At this crucial time, the West must continue to support #Ukraine in its time of need. Congress must do its part to hold Russia accountable and send the unmistakable signal to Putin and the rest of the world that the U.S. stands with #Ukraine. https://t.co/qTSk2KSdt3"
2022-11-30 18:23:27+00:00,I am encouraged by the success of the Ukrainian counteroffensive taking place. Aid from the U.S. has greatly assisted Ukraine’s position and has enabled Ukraine’s forces to liberate cities and save civilians from Russian authority.
2022-11-30 18:23:26+00:00,"During my recent visit to #Ukraine, I heard heroic stories of Ukrainian civilians standing up to Russian invaders against overwhelming odds. I also met with Ukrainian leaders to discuss the importance of U.S. assistance and the impact it is having on the battlefield."
2022-11-30 18:23:26+00:00,"Last night, I spoke on the Senate floor for the 26th consecutive session week to discuss Russia’s brutal and unprovoked attack on the people of #Ukraine."
2022-11-29 19:56:44+00:00,The ByteDance Risk Assessment also says TikTok is not reporting correct info to government agencies. This is outrageous.
2022-11-29 19:56:32+00:00,"Earlier this fall, in response to my questioning, TikTok’s COO refused to commit to cutting off all data &amp; metadata flows to China. Now a ByteDance Risk Assessment says it is not possible for the company to keep “sensitive and/or regulated data” from China https://t.co/kzEJHNPN2o"
2022-11-27 21:34:53+00:00,"Americans need a change, and I urge the Biden admin to work with Republicans to get back to pro-growth, common-sense economic policies."
2022-11-27 21:34:53+00:00,The U.S. economy grew at a 0.1% rate year-to-date and Americans are facing nearly 40 year high inflation. The Republican’s pre-pandemic trend of economic growth expected that growth would’ve continued at a 2.3% annual rate.
2022-11-27 21:34:52+00:00,"Soaring inflation, slowing economic growth, and a looming recession is partly the product of 21 months of Democrat mishandling and refusal to work in a bipartisan way to grow the economy."
2022-11-26 22:55:45+00:00,As well as better air defense systems to knock the Russian missiles out of the sky.
2022-11-26 22:55:44+00:00,"It’s important that the U.S. and our allies continue to supply #Ukraine with what it needs to win this war, including longer range missiles to be able to reach the Russian launching pads stop the deadly Russian attacks on civilians."
2022-11-26 22:55:44+00:00,"However, as #Ukraine wins on the battlefield, Russia is responding by bombing civilian targets all over #Ukraine, killing innocent Ukrainians."
2022-11-26 22:55:43+00:00,"Thanks to the amazing resolve of the Ukrainian people and assistance from the U.S. and its allies, #Ukraine is liberating its sovereign territory from the unprovoked, illegal and brutal Russian invasion."

2022-11-25 17:18:08+00:00,"This holiday season, Americans are feeling the pain of rising prices which have been a direct result of the Biden admin’s mismanagement of the economy."

2022-11-23 20:04:19+00:00,Paychecks continue to be eroded by runaway inflation that was fueled by the Democrats’ reckless spending spree. I urge the Biden admin to work with Republicans in order to stop runaway spending and promote pro-growth policies that were helping Americans prior to the pandemic. https://t.co/r0hSVj1TOW
2022-11-23 20:04:18+00:00,Inflation and surging grocery prices are squeezing Americans’ wallets this Thanksgiving. Families are struggling to keep up with soaring prices and now face the stress of the most expensive Thanksgiving in 40 years.

2022-11-21 15:06:19+00:00,"This would be almost 2x the current historic numbers of unlawful crossings, making a crisis a catastrophe. Time to fix a broken system!"
2022-11-21 15:06:18+00:00,"About half of the people who come to the southern without documents are currently turned away by Title 42. Yes, some are repeat crossers. But, if it ends as a court has ordered, @DHSgov expects ~18,000 unlawful migrants per day to cross into US."

2022-11-17 21:24:37+00:00,"In addition, I underscored the threats posed by our adversaries, such as Russia, Iran, &amp; China who rely on disinformation to weaken our democracy, &amp; the importance of separating the imminent threats of violence from censoring speech of American citizens. https://t.co/0vgubmIpvV"
2022-11-17 21:24:37+00:00,"Today, during our annual #HSGAC Threats to the Homeland hearing, I highlighted the ongoing crisis at the southern border, brought on by this admin’s failed border policies. Also, the failure of DHS vetting &amp; then paroling known or suspected Afghan terrorists into our communities."
2022-11-17 20:51:42+00:00,It was an honor to receive the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America’s Lifetime Achievement Award last night.

2022-11-16 18:51:53+00:00,"Congratulations @NASA on the launch of #Artemis I! This 42-day mission will circle the moon and return to Earth, laying the foundation for the future of human exploration."
2022-11-16 02:00:48+00:00,These investments will create thousands of #jobs and opportunities in the Buckeye State and will continue to ensure that #Ohio has the resources to fund and upgrade critical infrastructure for years to come.
2022-11-16 02:00:48+00:00,This has long been a priority of mine and will strengthen our economy.
2022-11-16 02:00:47+00:00,"Importantly, this bipartisan law has also paved a way for a solution to complete, once and for all, the Brent Spence Bridge Corridor Project in Cincinnati that will address the 2nd worst traffic bottleneck in the nation."
2022-11-16 02:00:47+00:00,"In the past year, #Ohio has received over $4 billion from the infrastructure law, including $258 million for public transportation, $209 million to repair and upgrade bridges, $54 million for airports, $20 million for Army Corps water projects &amp; $5 million for broadband."

2022-11-14 02:18:09+00:00,The FED is reducing demand by raising interest rates and unemployment with the only tools they have. That hurts. Congress needs to act on the fiscal side to help get us through this with pro-growth policies that increase supply and reduce costs for working families.
2022-11-14 02:18:09+00:00,"By every measure, working families are feeling the pain of record high inflation and rising prices. Paychecks continue to be eroded by soaring inflation."
2022-11-13 15:20:13+00:00,"Ukraine’s recent battlefield successes near Kerson continue to show that, with enough support from the West, they can win this war. Ukraine has proven that they deserve the support of freedom-loving countries around the world who value the territorial integrity of all nations."
2022-11-13 15:20:13+00:00,"Ukraine is a sovereign country and has every right to defend itself from Russia’s brutal attack. As Ukrainian forces continue to advance on the battlefield, we must provide them with the weapons they need to maintain their momentum."
2022-11-13 02:08:48+00:00,"The U.S. economy needs a change. I urge the Biden admin to work with Republicans to get back to pro-growth, common-sense economic policies that were helping Americans prior to the pandemic."
2022-11-13 02:08:48+00:00,Democrats’ deliberate policy choices including unprecedented stimulus spending and supply constraints on energy have driven inflation to the record high rates we see today.
2022-11-13 02:08:47+00:00,"This is the second straight holiday season of painfully high prices: in November 2021, consumer prices were up 6.8% from a year earlier."
2022-11-13 02:08:47+00:00,"High inflation is straining Americans’ budgets, making everything more expensive. Consumer prices have increased a total of 13.9% since @POTUS took office."
2022-11-12 23:05:44+00:00,"The liberation of Kherson is another well-executed and hard-fought victory that sends the message to the world that with the with the right tools, Ukraine can win this war."

https://t.co/F84mzu9xn3"
2022-11-09 17:36:05+00:00,"Great news out of southern #Ukraine today. This is the result of a well-executed and patient Ukrainian counteroffensive that was made possible by U.S. military aid, particularly HIMARS."
2022-11-06 20:27:43+00:00,The war crimes committed by Vladimir Putin and his associates are reprehensible and Russia should be held accountable for their horrific actions. #Ukraine has the right to defend itself against this unjustified invasion and the U.S. must not let up in our support now.
2022-11-06 20:27:42+00:00,"As Ukraine continues to defend itself against this brutal Russian invasion, it is clear that Ukrainian soldiers are putting weapons and equipment they receive from the West to good use."
2022-11-05 20:51:04+00:00,"It is critical that we come together as a global community to hold Vladimir Putin and his regime accountable, just as we have come together to support #Ukraine’s fight to defend itself."
2022-11-05 20:51:03+00:00,We also met with Prime Minister Rutte and commended his government for its leadership role in the fight for justice.
2022-11-05 20:51:03+00:00,President Putin must be held accountable for these crimes. This is why we went to The Hague to meet with officials from the International Criminal Court and Prosecutor Khan to discuss how the U.S. can better support their efforts to deliver justice to the people of Ukraine.
2022-11-05 20:51:02+00:00,"During my visit to Kyiv with @ChrisCoons, we saw compelling evidence that Vladimir Putin and other Russian leaders are committing atrocities and war crimes in #Ukraine."
2022-11-04 01:19:24+00:00,Thank you @OMarkarova. The United States stands with Ukraine in this fight against Russian aggression! Slava Ukraini!

2022-11-03 21:31:18+00:00,"I also met with the Ukrainian Prosecutor General @AndriyKostinUa, and discussed efforts in Ukraine, the United States, and at the International Criminal Court to investigate Vladimir Putin and his allies for war crimes."
2022-11-03 20:13:48+00:00,"I also visited the HQ of @NPCUkrenergo, site of a recent Russian attack on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Russian attacks on critical civilian infrastructure is of no military value but continues to cripple the Ukrainian economy and put the lives of Ukrainian civilians at risk. https://t.co/Tcdj0v7W3d"
2022-11-03 19:37:42+00:00,"Even as Russia bombs civilian infrastructure and commits violent atrocities, Ukrainian resolve does not waiver. The Ukrainian strength of spirit is seen every day on the battlefield, where Ukrainian armed forces continue to regain territory. https://t.co/350oVmiqi2"
2022-11-03 19:37:39+00:00,"In a meeting with @ZelenskyyUA today, I said the U.S. must remain committed to aiding Ukraine to victory. I believe a Ukrainian victory is necessary to reaffirm the importance of the sovereignty of free nations and the importance of upholding international law around the globe."

2022-10-30 22:58:42+00:00,Now economic growth is slowing. The U.S. economy grew at a 0.1% rate year-to-date and American’s are facing nearly 40 year high inflation.
2022-10-30 22:58:41+00:00,"Soaring inflation, slowing economic growth, and a looming recession is product of 21 months of Democrat policy mismanagement and refusal to work in a bipartisan way to grow the economy."
2022-10-30 21:33:52+00:00,Read my op-ed with @SenatorCardin in @thehill about the important legislation: https://t.co/4wEVX4fTBX

2022-10-29 00:45:10+00:00,The break in at Nancy Pelosi’s home and attack on her 82 year old husband is outrageous. We must all stand up against this violence. I wish Mr. Pelosi a speedy and full recovery.
2022-10-28 19:58:43+00:00,"According to recent data from @CBP, 98 individuals on the terror watchlist were apprehended trying to enter the US between ports of entry in the last year. When will this admin wake up to the danger posed by their failed border policies?"
2022-10-27 20:44:58+00:00,My op-ed with @SenatorCardin in @thehill highlights the need for Congress to complete work on bipartisan legislation to strengthen our country’s retirement system and help Americans better save for retirement. Check it out here: https://t.co/4wEVX4fTBX
2022-10-27 18:46:04+00:00,"The first 2 years of the Biden admin have been the highest 2 years of unlawful migration in our nation’s history. The Sept @CBP numbers show more than 227,500 total encounters at the border, a new record for the month of September."
2022-10-27 18:46:03+00:00,"The Biden admin’s border crisis has broken its own record for the most encounters during a fiscal year with 2.4 million border encounters, the highest of any fiscal year on record."
2022-10-27 15:46:50+00:00,"Instead of focusing on higher taxes and more spending, the Biden administration should work with Republicans on pro-growth policies that will improve our economy and help get flight inflation under control."
2022-10-27 15:46:50+00:00,"Moreover, wage growth is not keeping up with today’s surging inflation. That means families trying to make ends meet must try to do more with less. The Democrats’ reckless taxing and spending has made this crisis worse."
2022-10-27 15:46:49+00:00,"While today’s GDP report reflects increased exports, the American people continue to feel the painful effects of today’s skyrocketing inflation through higher costs for groceries, housing, and energy bills."
2022-10-24 23:35:05+00:00,"Today, I released a joint statement with @SenatorCardin in response to the distorted report from the @UN_HRC’s Commission of Inquiry (COI) into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Read our statement here: https://t.co/DKz8NoZoTE"
2022-10-24 21:08:46+00:00,"My bipartisan bill will coordinate efforts to protect US research, stop spies from hiding affiliations with foreign govts on grant applications, and give the State Dept the needed authority to stop bad actors from exploiting our open research community."
2022-10-24 21:08:45+00:00,"Like @FBIDirectorWray said earlier today, we are facing a “coordinated effort across the Chinese government to lie, cheat, and steal their way into unfairly dominating entire technology sectors.”"
2022-10-24 21:08:45+00:00,"The 3 recent indictments from DOJ against numerous Chinese spies operating in the US, some of whom used academic covers to attempt to steal US fingerprint technology, is another reason why Congress must pass my Safeguarding American Innovation Act."
2022-10-24 19:33:57+00:00,"Alarmingly, according to the @DEAHQ, the vast majority of fentanyl is getting across the southern border undetected. The lack of enforcement of our border by this admin is creating a pull factor for Mexican transnational criminal orgs to push deadly drugs into our communities."
2022-10-24 19:33:53+00:00,"The Sept @CBP operational stats show that 1,826lbs of fentanyl were seized last month, more than enough to kill every American. This surge in deadly illicit narcotics coming over our border continues to endanger lives in #Ohio &amp; the US."
2022-10-24 03:04:38+00:00,"By every measure, working families are feeling the pain of rising prices. Americans need relief and we must stop stimulus spending contributing to this record inflation and promote pro-growth, common-sense economic policies."
2022-10-24 03:04:38+00:00,"In the last year alone grocery prices rose 13%, the fastest pace since the summer of 1981. Items like cereal, butter, flour, frozen fruits and vegetables, desserts, and soups all experienced their largest ever annual increase in cost."
2022-10-24 03:04:37+00:00,Americans are getting squeezed by surging grocery prices. Since @POTUS took office grocery prices have risen by 17.7%.
2022-10-23 16:12:14+00:00,It is clear that Ukrainian soldiers are putting weapons &amp; equipment provided by the US &amp; over 40 countries to good use &amp; making progress on the battlefield. #Ukraine has the right to defend itself against this unjustified invasion and the U.S. must not let up in our support now.
2022-10-23 16:12:13+00:00,"After 9 months of Russia’s aggression, #Ukraine continues a bold counteroffensive to retake more of Russian-occupied territory in the east and south."
2022-10-23 16:12:12+00:00,The United States and our allies must continue to provide additional air defense systems to help #Ukraine defend against these barbaric Russian missle attacks on civilians.
2022-10-22 23:37:58+00:00,"American families need common-sense economic policies that Republicans had in place prior to the pandemic that produced record economic growth, higher wages, and low inflation."
2022-10-22 23:37:58+00:00,"Bad policies that dramatically expanded stimulus spending and demand for goods while restricting the supply of products, including energy, have helped fuel the highest level of inflation in 40 years and Americans are now paying the price."

2022-10-21 19:45:02+00:00,"At a recent #HSGAC hearing, TikTok’s executive refused to commit to cutting off Americans’ data from China-based employees. American data should be safe from exploitation by the CCP. https://t.co/FhT0eAjMr6"

2022-10-19 15:45:19+00:00,Threats to American national security are growing every day. We must ensure our military is prepared to deter and defeat those threats by increasing our investment in critical capabilities.

2022-10-16 21:00:03+00:00,The war crimes committed by Vladimir Putin and his military are reprehensible and Russia should be held accountable. #Ukraine has the right to defend itself against this unjustified invasion and the U.S. and the entire free world must not let up in our support now.
2022-10-16 20:59:40+00:00,"Last week, I called for the United States and our allies to provide additional security aid, specifically air defense systems, to help #Ukraine defend itself against these unjustified attacks on civilians far from the frontlines.  https://t.co/VFtHg6YTfi"

2022-10-16 14:44:19+00:00,"Americans have seen every aspect of their cost of living rise. Necessities like energy, food, and rent have become unaffordable for many families, wages haven’t kept up, and pensions and 401(k) plans have been diminished."
2022-10-16 14:44:18+00:00,"Unfortunately, the increased inflation rates the Biden admin called “transitory” show no signs of slowing, and middle-class families are feeling the consequences. Americans are experiencing nearly 40 year high inflation everywhere."

2022-10-15 19:49:31+00:00,"President Putin called his invasion of Ukraine “correct and timely.” Nothing could be further from the truth. It is wrong, unprovoked, and brutal. Russia must be held accountable for its disregard for Ukraine’s sovereignty and the killing of innocent civilians."
2022-10-15 15:52:06+00:00,"In order to do so, we must stop stimulus spending contributing to demand this record inflation, unleash energy production, cut regulations, and promote pro-growth, common-sense economic policies."
2022-10-15 15:52:05+00:00,Republicans and Democrats should both want to make life more affordable for working families.
2022-10-15 15:52:05+00:00,"Since @POTUS took office, inflation has soared with prices rising 13.5% in the last 20 months. Yet Democrats continue policies that deliver high prices: increased taxes, unprecedented stimulus spending and restricted supply of energy."
2022-10-14 21:30:31+00:00,"The U.S. must recommit itself to helping Ukraine defend its sovereign territory. Ukraine’s recent battlefield successes continue to show that, with enough support from the West, it can win this war."

2022-10-10 21:02:16+00:00,The best way to force an end to these attacks on civilians is to provide Ukraine with the weapons it needs to defeat Russian forces on the battlefield.
2022-10-10 21:02:16+00:00,I also call for the United States and our allies to provide additional security aid to help Ukraine defend itself against these unjustified attacks. Ukraine has the right to defend itself against this unjustified and illegal invasion.
2022-10-10 21:02:15+00:00,"Like it has done several times in this war, Russia is trying to cope with its setbacks on the battlefield by lashing out against innocent Ukrainian civilians. These war crimes are reprehensible and Vladimir Putin and his associates should be held accountable."
2022-10-10 21:02:15+00:00,I condemn the intentional attacks on civilian targets across Ukraine in the strongest possible terms and call on the international community to do the same.
2022-10-10 11:28:43+00:00,Celebrating Taiwanese freedom is more important than ever as China’s aggression against the sovereign territory continues to grow.
2022-10-10 11:28:43+00:00,"Today on Taiwan National Day, I am proud to stand with Taiwan and congratulate them on their successful democracy and contributions to the international community."
2022-10-09 17:41:46+00:00,Ukraine is a sovereign country and has every right to defend itself and deserves the support of freedom-loving countries around the world who value the territorial integrity of all nations.
2022-10-09 17:41:45+00:00,Attacks like this as well as the numerous war crimes Russia is committing should be condemned in the strongest possible terms and the international community should hold Vladimir Putin accountable.
2022-10-09 13:56:56+00:00,Great to visit the @180thFW at the Toledo Air National Guard Base last week. While there I received an update on their mission set and was given a tour of the finished permanent hangars. I am thankful for all of those who have answered the call to serve our country and #Ohio. https://t.co/RuMNpZ0B7k
2022-10-08 21:39:40+00:00,"Ukraine’s bold counteroffensive has shown that this assistance will further strengthen Ukrainian forces, allowing them to continue to push back on Russia’s aggression."
2022-10-08 21:39:39+00:00,It is clear that Ukrainian soldiers are putting these weapons and equipment to good use and making increments on the battlefield. We must not let up in our support now.
2022-10-08 21:39:39+00:00,"I am encouraged by the Biden admin’s announcement this week to send further assistance to #Ukraine, which includes 4 more HIMARS."
2022-10-08 19:53:56+00:00,"Instead of more taxes and spending, we should pursue common-sense economic policies put in before the pandemic and produced low unemployment, significant job gains, and record wage growth – all with low inflation. https://t.co/czYFXjMh0Q"
2022-10-08 19:53:56+00:00,"According to @TheFGA, #Ohio’s inflation has risen 13.8% under @POTUS. More stimulus and less supply equals higher inflation and is a direct result of Democrats’ policy decisions."
2022-10-08 15:57:05+00:00,"I visited military installations across #Ohio including @180thFW, @121ARW, @Battelle, and @NASAArmstrong to learn how Congress can better support #Ohio’s military installations and defense industries."
2022-10-08 15:57:05+00:00,"During my Ohio defense tour this week, I had the opportunity to meet with lots of inspiring Ohio patriots who have answered the call to serve our country."
2022-10-08 14:06:54+00:00,It was great to be back at @NASAArmstrong yesterday to learn more about their cutting edge work. #Ohio is the birthplace of aviation and the extraordinary work of everyone at the Neil A. Armstrong facility will keep our state at the tip of the spear for the aviation industry. https://t.co/oBUAtXGowi
2022-10-07 22:38:43+00:00,"At a July #HSGAC hearing, I stressed how critical it is to prohibit the purchase of drones made by our adversaries, like #China. I urge my colleagues to include the bipartisan American Security Drone Act in this year’s defense bill to do just that. https://t.co/LsPTc1XSol"
2022-10-07 22:38:42+00:00,"I’m alarmed that the @FBI, @DHSgov, &amp; US law enforcement are continuing to purchase and use Chinese-made drones despite significant national security concerns about their use. 
https://t.co/MrXCcsiSG9"
2022-10-07 15:36:32+00:00,We also discussed the importance of ensuring more #Ohioans have the skills and training they need to find #jobs throughout the state through my bipartisan JOBS Act. https://t.co/uc6EZZaEdC
2022-10-07 15:36:31+00:00,"Great to join the @toledochamber this morning for a roundtable where we discussed the benefits of my bipartisan infrastructure law, which is providing funding for long overdue projects around Toledo."
2022-10-06 16:32:14+00:00,"After my office helped to cut the red tape, I had the pleasure of meeting with Olena and Svitlana Mladenova, now reunited, and hear of Svitlana's harrowing journey from occupied Ukraine to safety in the U.S. https://t.co/q2D9R5addD"
2022-10-06 16:32:12+00:00,I saw firsthand during my trips to Ukraine and Eastern Europe the vast number of displaced Ukrainians driven from their homes by Russian aggression.
2022-10-06 14:31:30+00:00,"I support the resettlement of Afghans who stood in battle with us &amp; our allies over the last 20 yrs, but due to this admin’s catastrophic, dysfunctional evacuation of Afghans, US faces an increased national security threat. https://t.co/CUT8s6lYvi"
2022-10-06 14:31:16+00:00,A report released by @DHSgov OIG confirms Biden admin’s Afghan evacuee process was plagued by poor planning &amp; mismanagement from the start. It found the DHS Unified Coordination Group tasked w/ managing the op was not initially funded &amp; didn’t have clear &amp; direct authority.
2022-10-06 12:51:57+00:00,"Instead of working to support the exploration, development, and production of our own natural resources, the Biden administration is continuing to look to unfriendly nations for oil, risking our national and energy security.
https://t.co/DZf0XFDxi5"
2022-10-06 03:05:31+00:00,I’ve worked during my time in the Senate to support Ohio’s defense installations like Rickenbacker and am proud of our servicemembers for all they do for Ohio and our country’s national security. https://t.co/vhrkR4OLqa
2022-10-06 03:05:29+00:00,"Great to visit the @121ARW Air Refueling Wing at Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base in Columbus today. I received an update on its current mission set, KC-135 modernization, and even took the controls in the KC-135 Flight Deck Simulator."
2022-10-06 01:08:30+00:00,We also emphasized my bipartisan Offices of Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction and Health Security Act to enhance the federal government’s ability to detect threats from weapons of mass destruction and create a strategy to protect our nation from public health threats. https://t.co/kPwkmTU5fC
2022-10-06 01:08:29+00:00,Very impressed by the team at #Ohio-based @Battelle today. We discussed their updated BD21 efforts and took a tour of their PFAS Annihilator which they are collaborating with federal agencies on.
2022-10-05 19:22:35+00:00,The Biden admin’s failure to use our own abundant supply of energy resources here in America is crushing the U.S. economy. The best option to reduce costs for American families is for @POTUS to support North American energy production. https://t.co/4hnYyhBP3t
2022-10-05 19:22:35+00:00,"We need to have an all-of-the-above energy strategy for our country, which includes domestic oil and gas production and refining."
2022-10-05 19:22:34+00:00,"At a time when energy security is critical to our national security, it is concerning that the Biden administration has leased fewer acres for oil and gas drilling offshore and on federal land at this point in its administration in 50 years."
2022-10-05 01:17:33+00:00,had the best hamburger and pumpkin pie at the famous K’s Hamburger Shop in Troy today - A great #Ohio tradition that has been in the same family for 87 years! https://t.co/rKYTSB5sLo
2022-10-04 19:53:43+00:00,"For over 85 years, Airstream has been a front runner in innovation and outdoor recreation and is vital to the economy and community in the Buckeye state. https://t.co/shFtJt4t51"
2022-10-04 19:53:42+00:00,It was great to join @Airstream_Inc today and tour their recently expanded manufacturing factory and new Heritage Center Museum. We discussed the importance of outdoor recreation and conservation and emphasized the importance of my bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act and JOBS Act.
2022-10-04 18:20:54+00:00,"However, the administration must work with our allies to provide even more advanced systems to Ukraine. As @ZelenskyyUA has said, Ukraine needs tanks, IFVs, air defense systems, and advanced fighter jets to defend its cities and push the Russians back."
2022-10-04 18:20:54+00:00,Russia’s forces in the south – some of its best – are now on the run.
2022-10-04 18:20:53+00:00,"U.S.-provided assistance has enabled these recent counteroffensives in Kharkiv and Kherson Oblasts. In particular, Ukrainian forces have used U.S.-provided HIMARS launchers and rockets to soften up Russian forces in these areas, striking ammo dumps and command &amp; control posts."
2022-10-04 18:20:53+00:00,Ukrainian soldiers are putting these weapons and equipment to excellent use. That is clear on the battlefield every day.
2022-10-04 18:20:52+00:00,"Recent Ukrainian breakthroughs near Kherson, coupled with ongoing successes in Kharkiv Oblast, are more proof that Ukraine is worthy of increased military assistance from the U.S. in its fight against Russia’s invasion."
2022-10-04 18:20:51+00:00,"These weapons will further strengthen Ukrainian forces, allowing them to maintain their current momentum and keep the Russians on defense."
2022-10-04 18:20:50+00:00,"I was pleased to see the administration’s announcement of further assistance to Ukraine today, which included four more HIMARS launchers and rockets, as well as dozens of other artillery systems."
2022-10-04 17:10:55+00:00,"Considering that the recent funding measure fulfilled the @FBI request for $15M+ to investigate the growing list of security concerns among the evacuees, I’m disappointed @DHSgov continues to deny its failure to properly screen &amp; prepare for these evacuees."
2022-10-04 17:10:55+00:00,"These latest 2 reports found @DHSgov did not track evacuees who failed to comply with medical screening &amp; other conditions of their parole, including the ability to know where they went &amp; that the Biden admin began evacuation ops without any clear authority."
2022-10-04 17:10:55+00:00,"There have now been 4 IG reports that confirm what I’ve been saying for more than a year, the systematic weaknesses of the Afghanistan evacuation puts our communities at risk. https://t.co/CUT8s6DzTS"
2022-10-03 00:37:53+00:00,All the more reason for Congress should pass my common sense Chase COVID Unemployment Fraud Act to recover fraudulent pandemic unemployment payments by providing incentives and tools necessary for states to recover stolen pandemic funds. https://t.co/v6HdBixrNA
2022-10-03 00:37:53+00:00,I urge DOJ to investigate and hold anyone engaged in this theft accountable. The allegation is that millions of taxpayer dollars from hardworking Americans meant to help those out-of-work because of COVID instead went to criminals &amp; cheats working for our own govt.
2022-10-03 00:37:52+00:00,"If the @DHSgov OIG allegations are correct that DHS employees potentially made more than $2.6M in fraudulent pandemic unemployment claims, that means some those in charge of protecting our homeland were exploiting it for personal gain. https://t.co/GVjZRFRJlR"
2022-10-02 22:00:04+00:00,This is horrifying. The U.S. stands with Ukraine to hold Russia accountable for its horrifying war crimes.
2022-10-02 17:04:39+00:00,"We need to work in a bipartisan way to return to the pro-growth policies we had before the pandemic that led to strong economic growth and significant job and wage gains, all while keeping inflation low."
2022-10-02 17:04:39+00:00,"In addition to inflation remaining at a near 40-year high, @BEA_News confirmed in its latest estimate this week that the economy contracted in Q2. In addition, wages are not keeping up with prices and as a result the American people are hurting."
2022-10-01 23:58:42+00:00,"What is different this time is that Ukraine and its allies in the United States, Europe, and around the world are ready, united, and prepared to help defeat Russian aggression and stop the war atrocities."
2022-10-01 23:58:41+00:00,The ‘referendum’ votes were manipulated by Russia in order to manufacture an excuse to declare that the territory belongs to Russia and justify an illegal annexation. This is straight out of the Kremlin’s playbook from its illegitimate ‘annexation’ of Crimea in 2014.
2022-10-01 23:58:41+00:00,"Just like Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine, this is a clear violation of the UN Charter, the Hague Regulations of 1907, and the fundamental right of sovereign territorial integrity."
2022-10-01 23:58:40+00:00,"Russia’s latest ‘annexation’, and the ‘referendum’ coerced votes that preceded it in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts, are a sham and illegitimate."
2022-10-01 16:34:17+00:00,Best of luck to undefeated @OhioStateFB today as they take on @RFootball! #GoBucks!
2022-10-01 13:47:35+00:00,"Our economy doesn’t need more tax hikes &amp; stimulus spending, it needs the Biden admin to work with Republicans on the pro-growth, common-sense economic policies that were working prior to the pandemic to keep inflation down &amp; wages up, while growing the economy at a steady rate."
2022-10-01 13:47:35+00:00,"I wish we could say inflation is under control, but just this week @BEA_News announced the personal consumption expenditure price index increased 0.6% since last month."
2022-10-01 13:47:34+00:00,"Americans continue to face painfully high inflation, which is a direct result of policy decisions: higher demand thru the Democrats’ unprecedented stimulus spending and constraints on supply, particularly energy."
2022-09-30 22:36:33+00:00,"The future of not only Ukraine but eastern Europe is at stake. Like many dictators before him, President Putin is trying to rewrite the borders of Europe with violence. We must ensure that he fails."
2022-09-30 22:36:32+00:00,"Russian energy revenue has increased 30% this year. That is unacceptable if we want to slow down Putin’s war machine. To that end, @USTreasury should not renew General License 8C, which allows certain Russian energy transactions to continue without being subject to sanctions."
2022-09-30 22:36:32+00:00,"Russia’s latest land grab and “referendum” vote is illegitimate and a sham. I commend the admin for responding quickly and forcefully with sanctions. However, much more needs to be done, especially to sanction Russia’s energy sector, which is largely funding its war effort."
2022-09-30 21:29:49+00:00,Continuing to pray for all those impacted by #HurricaneIan and sending best wishes to @OhioTaskForce1 as they respond to this catastrophe by helping those in need in Florida. https://t.co/eRSDelq2wH
2022-09-30 18:56:19+00:00,"Combined with yesterday’s news that the economy is continuing to contract, this is very troubling for working families. We need to get back to the pro-growth policies we had before the pandemic that led to one of the strongest economies in a generation. https://t.co/Ie4TTuBYaX"
2022-09-30 18:56:19+00:00,"Another troubling sign for the economy as yet another measure of inflation, the personal consumption expenditure price index, increased 4.9% from a year ago and 0.6% since last month. Everywhere I go, people tell me they are hurting from high prices and wages not keeping up."
2022-09-30 17:56:22+00:00,"The Talbert House advocates for those who are struggling with addiction, homelessness, mental health, and those who need a second chance. They were also instrumental in crafting my bipartisan CARA legislation, which responds to the epidemic of substance use. https://t.co/gUpbY8pfZl"
2022-09-30 17:56:21+00:00,It was great to join @TalbertHouse yesterday and accept the Agnes Seasongood Award at their annual luncheon. I am proud of the work they have done to help people across the greater Cincinnati region on their road to recovery.
2022-09-30 12:59:43+00:00,Russia is trying to claim sovereignty over territory that he barely controls - territory that he is losing every day. This will not help Russia’s war effort and only strengthen Western resolve.
2022-09-30 12:59:42+00:00,"These illegal Russian claims on sovereign Ukrainian territory, coupled with President Putin’s nuclear threats and poorly executed mass mobilization, are frantic attempts to try to stop Ukraine’s successful counteroffensive."
2022-09-30 12:59:42+00:00,I condemn this latest illegitimate landgrab by President Putin in the strongest possible terms. These actions are just another sign of Russia’s increasing desperation as its war effort falters.
2022-09-30 01:53:44+00:00,"As Russia seeks to escalate this war with its so-called “annexations” of sovereign Ukrainian territory, we must meet that threat with firm U.S. support."
2022-09-30 01:53:43+00:00,These weapons systems have been effective at turning the tide of the war so the administration should provide more long-range missiles as soon as possible.
2022-09-30 01:53:42+00:00,"Since these 18 systems may not arrive in Ukraine for several years, this announcement is an important demonstration of America’s long-term support for Ukraine."
2022-09-30 01:53:42+00:00,I was pleased by the administration’s announcement yesterday that it will fund the construction and delivery of 18 more HIMARS to Ukraine. These will form a crucial part of Ukraine’s future fighting force.
2022-09-29 17:57:01+00:00,"I continue to urge the administration and Congress to get back to the pro-growth policies we had before the pandemic that led to the best economy we had in a generation, including significant job gains and wage growth for all Americans."
2022-09-29 17:57:01+00:00,The latest estimate from @BEA_News shows once again that the U.S. economy contracted in Q2. Our economy is in a recession and Americans continue to experience record high inflation. This is a direct result of the Democrats’ latest reckless tax and spending spree.
2022-09-29 14:44:14+00:00,This OIG report makes it clear that we must pass my legislation to pursue recovery of fraudulent payments by ensuring aggressive investigation and prosecution of criminal fraud in pandemic unemployment programs. https://t.co/hFTn46SN7Q
2022-09-29 14:44:13+00:00,"If these allegations are correct, those in charge of protecting our homeland were exploiting it for personal gain. I urge the Department of Justice to hold these federal government employees accountable. https://t.co/GVjZRG8MnR"
2022-09-29 14:44:12+00:00,I’m alarmed by this @DHSgov OIG report that DHS employees potentially made more than $2.6M in fraudulent pandemic unemployment claims. Millions of taxpayer $ from hardworking Americans meant to help those out-of-work instead went to criminals &amp; cheats working for our own govt.
2022-09-29 01:46:09+00:00,We must continue to stand with #Ukraine for as long as it takes as they defend democracy and lead the global effort to ensure that freedom’s flame is not extinguished in Ukraine.
2022-09-29 01:46:09+00:00,"The U.S. and our allies must continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons it needs to roll back Russia’s illegal occupation of Ukraine. At this crucial time, the West must continue to support #Ukraine in its time of need."
2022-09-29 01:46:08+00:00,The sham ‘referendums’ being conducted by Russia’s proxies on sovereign #Ukrainian territory are completely illegitimate and will not be recognized by the United States or the international community.
2022-09-29 01:46:08+00:00,I am encouraged by the success of the Ukrainian counteroffensive taking place in northeast #Ukraine. Aid from the U.S. has greatly improved Ukraine’s position across the battlefield and has enabled Ukraine’s forces to degrade and roll back Russia’s invasion.
2022-09-29 01:46:08+00:00,"This week, the Senate Ukraine Caucus hosted Ukraine ambassador @OMarkarova and members of the Ukrainian parliament to discuss the latest events regarding Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of #Ukraine and how the Senate can continue to better support our ally through."

2022-09-27 21:20:02+00:00,"We must act. If not, children and all Americans could be exposed to these deadly narcotics because of dysfunctional bureaucratic turf wars."
2022-09-27 21:20:02+00:00,"Due to an outdated law written decades before DHS was created, only DEA and FBI can fully investigate drug crimes. DHS Special Agents are currently prohibited from deploying their state and local law enforcement partners to the counter-drug fight."

2022-09-25 23:45:55+00:00,"Instead of promoting pro-growth policies that led to a strong economy before the pandemic, Democrats have doubled down on the same irresponsible tax and spend policies and regulations that got our economy into the situation it’s in now."
2022-09-25 23:45:54+00:00,"This has led to the highest inflation the U.S. has experienced in nearly 40 years. The Biden admin’s policies have undermined our efforts to recharge our economy, grow jobs, and increase wages."
2022-09-25 23:45:54+00:00,"Last year, Republicans and some Democrats warned that injecting too much stimulus into the economy would increase inflation. Sadly, the Democratic leadership didn’t listen and continued on their path of reckless spending."
2022-09-25 21:00:34+00:00,"I commend @GOPLeader and @HouseGOP for unveiling an agenda that is pro economic growth, will help secure the border, increase domestic energy production and restore individual liberty."
2022-09-25 15:27:57+00:00,President Putin must not be allowed to change the borders of Europe by force. It’s important that we continue to supply Ukraine with what it needs to win this war. Freedom in Eastern Europe is at stake and the West must continue to show our steadfast support.
2022-09-25 15:27:57+00:00,"The U.S. and our allies must continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons it needs to roll back Russia’s illegal occupation of Ukrainian territory. Ukraine, along with aid from the U.S. and its allies, which include long-range missiles, is beginning to regain ground on Russia."
2022-09-25 15:27:56+00:00,The sham ‘referendums’ being conducted this weekend by Russia’s proxies on sovereign Ukrainian territory are completely illegitimate and will not be recognized by the United States or the international community.

2022-09-11 02:29:46+00:00,"Instead of more taxes and spending, we should pursue common-sense economic policies that Republicans enacted before the pandemic and produced historically low unemployment, significant job gains, and steady wage growth – all with low inflation."
2022-09-11 02:29:45+00:00,This higher inflation started after Democrats passed their $1.9 trillion stimulus bill last year and will be made worse by their latest tax and stimulus spending bill.

2022-09-07 20:57:07+00:00,I urge the admin to change course &amp; accept recommendations made by the OIG to immediately identify all evacuees from Afghanistan in the US &amp; provide evidence of full screening &amp; vetting &amp; develop a comprehensive plan for future emergency situations.
2022-09-07 20:57:07+00:00,"It is very concerning the OIG told @DHSgov to address security risks &amp; that DHS continues to deny there is a problem, even as the @FBI is investigating evacuees that have been flagged as potential threats to our national security."

2022-09-07 11:30:42+00:00,I thank our European allies for all they are doing and urge them to continue to step up their support of #Ukraine at this critical time. Now it is not time to equivocate.
2022-09-07 11:30:41+00:00,"I am encouraged that the U.S. is sending Abrams battle tanks, made in my home state of #Ohio, to Poland. This will send a critical message to Russia that the United States stands for freedom not only in #Ukraine but throughout all of Europe and the world."
2022-09-07 11:30:41+00:00,"The Russians have captured Europe's single largest nuclear power plant, and have taken the Ukrainian employees captive. Russia continues to irresponsibly use oil, gas, and energy as a weapon of war."
2022-09-07 11:30:40+00:00,We also heard extensively about the recent progress in increasing oversight and accountability for U.S. economic and military aid to Ukraine. I am hopeful that progress on this important issue will continue.

2022-08-10 20:40:58+00:00,"This surge in inflation all started after congressional Democrats passed their $1.9 trillion stimulus bill last year, and they just passed another reckless tax and spending spree last weekend that will make inflation worse."

2022-08-07 19:52:59+00:00,"Democrats will also tax employee stock ownership programs, or ESOPs, in this package. ESOPs enjoy bipartisan support in Congress. Punishing this ownership structure will again discourage investment and hard work and could not come at a worse time."
2022-08-07 19:52:58+00:00,"Taxing stock buybacks lowers the price of stocks and hurts all Americans invested in the market through their 401(k)s, IRAs, and other retirement accounts. So, the reality is this is a tax on working families who are trying to save for retirement."
2022-08-07 19:52:56+00:00,"The Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan group, just last year said they expect that 25% of these corporate taxes to fall on workers."

2022-08-05 15:18:24+00:00,Higher taxes also mean lower wages for workers and higher prices for consumers at a time when paychecks are lagging behind high inflation.
2022-08-05 15:18:23+00:00,"The latest report from @BEA_News shows gross domestic private investment down 13.5%, which helped lower economic growth to minus 0.9% in the second quarter."
2022-08-05 15:18:23+00:00,This new tax would discourage investment just as policy makers have learned that our negative economic growth is in large part the result of lower investment.
2022-08-05 15:18:23+00:00,"Imposing this new tax on U.S. companies, and restricting certain U.S. manufacturers from writing off investment costs immediately, would make America less competitive and drive investment and jobs overseas."

2022-08-05 15:18:22+00:00,The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that nearly 50% of this new “book tax” would fall on manufacturers—the effects of which could prove devastating. China currently has more than a quarter of the world’s manufacturing.
2022-08-05 15:18:22+00:00,"If enacted, about 200 American companies employing millions of Americans could be subject to this tax. Now, during a recession, is not the time to raise taxes on job creators."

2022-07-26 02:41:58+00:00,"Putin’s attempt to divide @NATO has failed and over Russian objections, #NATO soon will be expanding. I look forward to confirming Finland and Sweden’s requests to join #NATO and the Senate must approve their applications before the Senate adjourns in August."
2022-07-26 02:41:58+00:00,I am encouraged that the Biden admin agreed to send #Ukraine 4 more HIMARS to target Russian forces from longer distances. These artillery systems have been critical as they allow the #Ukrainian military to successfully counter Russian attacks.
2022-07-26 02:41:57+00:00,"This weekend, Russia violated an agreement to lift its blockade on #Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, which is preventing millions of tons of grain from being exported and creating a global food crisis."

2022-07-24 22:57:09+00:00,"In #Ohio, there has been a deadly rise in the prevalence and use of counterfeit prescription pills laced with fentanyl. These imitation pills can look exactly like prescription drugs, but even small traces of fentanyl can be deadly."

2022-07-24 00:00:04+00:00,"As a global military power, the US has many of these systems in our inventory. We must provide #Ukraine with more of them and other needed weapon systems so they win this brutal and unprovoked war by Russia."
2022-07-24 00:00:03+00:00,"For a couple of months, I have advocated that the Biden admin send #Ukraine the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems or HIMARS they badly need to be able to target invading Russian forces from longer distances."

2022-07-23 17:13:07+00:00,"I urge the Biden Admin to work with Republicans to get back to pro-growth, common-sense economic policies that were working before the pandemic so that #Ohio families can get some relief from inflation that is making it harder and harder to get ahead."
2022-07-23 17:13:07+00:00,"The other reason was constricted supply from COVID, and deliberate policy decisions like discouraging domestic fossil fuel production."
2022-07-23 17:13:07+00:00,The Democrats’ stimulus spending spree last year was the main fuel behind the inflation surge. They were warned that the record $1.9 trillion spending bill would overheat the economy but did it anyway.

2022-07-12 03:23:34+00:00,I urged the admin to send #Ukraine more HIMARS. The U.S. is a global military power and has hundreds of these in our inventory. We must approve more than 12 systems to provide #Ukrainians with the vital assistance they need.

2022-06-06 16:17:33+00:00,"Today is the 78th anniversary of D-Day, when 160k Allied troops stormed the beaches of Normandy and signaled a turning point in WWII."
2022-06-06 02:08:39+00:00,"If Russia continues to advance, more and more #Ukrainian civilian and military lives will be lost."
2022-06-06 02:08:38+00:00,"Sadly, the delay has cost #Ukraine dearly in lives and territory. Although the #Ukrainians are fighting bravely in the east, they are outgunned by the Russians. The U.S. and allies must speed up delivery of this critical support for #Ukraine."
2022-06-06 02:08:38+00:00,"Now let’s speed these needed weapons to the frontlines, approve more than the reported four systems and urge our allies to follow suit to give #Ukrainians a fighting chance."
2022-06-06 02:08:38+00:00,I am glad that the administration has finally decided to provide longer range rocket artillery systems to #Ukraine to try to level the battlefield with Russia’s longer range weapons.
2022-06-05 22:23:14+00:00,"This combination of rising prices, wages not keeping up and higher interest rates is what could put us into a recession if we don’t work together to promote common sense, pro-growth economic policies that were working before the pandemic."
2022-06-05 22:23:14+00:00,"To make matters worse, Americans’ paychecks are not keeping up with the price hikes, which means families will continue to take pay cuts month after month."
2022-06-05 22:23:14+00:00,The Biden admin continues to burden American consumers with 40-year inflation highs. The latest @USCBO report projects the consumer price index to rise 6.1% this year.
2022-06-05 17:00:47+00:00,I urge the Biden admin to promote all-of-the-above American energy production to provide relief for Americans. We must take tangible steps to lower energy costs by working together to find a bipartisan solution.
2022-06-05 17:00:46+00:00,That certainly hasn’t helped but most of the gas price increase happened before the invasion and is the result of deliberate policies to stifle American oil and gas production.
2022-06-05 17:00:46+00:00,"As summer arrives, Americans are paying record high prices for gas with no relief in sight. Since @POTUS took office, gas prices have DOUBLED. It is just not accurate to say this is the result of Russia‘s war on #Ukraine."
2022-06-05 14:20:07+00:00,"With Russia’s incremental gains in the eastern part of the country, more needs to be done quickly before more ground is yielded to Putin’s war machine."
2022-06-05 14:20:07+00:00,"While I am glad the admin is sending longer range artillery (HIMARS) to #Ukraine, only sending four systems is inadequate for their needs, and I am afraid that by the time they are in place it will be too late for many Ukrainian soldiers and civilians."
2022-06-04 19:44:46+00:00,"Instead of more stimulus spending and then relying on the Fed to reduce demand by increasing interest rates, it is time for Democrats to work with Republicans on pro-growth policies that will expand supply and get inflation under control."
2022-06-04 19:44:45+00:00,"This has caused the worst inflation in 40 years. Families deserve pro-growth policies that create American #jobs without high inflation, not the reckless spending that Democrats want to continue."
2022-06-04 19:44:45+00:00,This lead to high demand at a time of constricted supply due to COVID and the Russian war in #Ukraine but also regulations on energy and other sectors.
2022-06-04 19:44:44+00:00,"According to the @USCBO, inflation will continue to skyrocket through the end of this year. American families are experiencing the results of irresponsible stimulus spending that the Biden Admin pushed thru on a partisan basis."

2022-06-03 19:33:02+00:00,The U.S. must continue to send more of these systems immediately to help #Ukraine fight off Russia’s onslaught.
2022-06-03 19:33:01+00:00,"While the Admin’s decision to send four advanced rocket artillery systems to #Ukraine is a welcome step, this is too little, too late. This should have been done weeks ago."
2022-06-03 19:33:01+00:00,Today marks 100th day since Russia’s brutal and unwarranted attack on #Ukraine. There is much more to be done and the U.S. and its allies must not let up in our support for the #Ukrainian people.
2022-06-02 16:15:33+00:00,"Today, @Ford announced plans to add more than 6,200 new U.S. manufacturing jobs across the Midwest. #Ohio will receive a total of $1.6 billion in investments and 1,890 new #jobs. Great news for the Buckeye state!"
2022-06-02 02:43:55+00:00,These new rocket artillery systems must now be put in service without delay and in large enough numbers to actually make a difference on the battlefield.
2022-06-02 02:43:54+00:00,"Brave Ukrainian soldiers and non-combatant civilians are being killed every day by the Russian invasion. In order to stop the deadly assault and turn the tide in favor of Ukrainians, the Admin must respond more quickly to the needs on the battlefield."
2022-06-02 02:43:54+00:00,"This is good news, and something I have been calling for, but it took too long and I fear that by the time the systems are operational Ukraine will have lost more soldiers and more land in the fierce fighting in the eastern part of the country."
2022-06-02 02:43:54+00:00,"Today, the administration formally notified Congress that it will provide Ukraine with rocket artillery systems they need to respond to Russian attacks."
2022-05-31 17:43:05+00:00,"According to President Biden, “The price at the pump is elevated in large part because Russian oil, gas and refining capacity are off the market.” But we know fuel prices increased by 48% before Russia’s invasion into #Ukraine."
2022-05-31 17:43:05+00:00,"Today, gas is $4.62. The highest recorded average in American history."
2022-05-31 17:43:04+00:00,"Instead of offering real solutions, President Biden announced that he would “let the @federalreserve do their job” in his most recent @WSJ Op ed. This is not a solution. Nor is blaming Russia for prices at the pump."
2022-05-31 17:43:04+00:00,This is due to the Biden admin’s excessive spending that even Democrat economist Larry Summers warned would overheat the economy along with misguided energy policies that have contributed to historically high energy prices.
2022-05-31 17:43:03+00:00,Inflation is at its highest level in nearly 40 years. The price of everything from gas prices to groceries to housing has skyrocketed and working families are feeling the effects.
2022-05-31 15:11:53+00:00,"Although this is a positive step, Europe must continue on its path to fully ban all Russian energy. As I have been saying on the Senate floor, the U.S. should continue to strengthen our partnership with the EU through this transition to energy independence from Russia."
2022-05-30 21:26:23+00:00,"It was clear during my meetings in Europe, including with a senior Ukrainian liaison at @US_EUCOM and other allied countries, that #Ukraine needs this weapons system now to defend against the continued Russian assault on their country."
2022-05-30 21:26:22+00:00,"The MLRS is defensive, conventional weaponry that would help balance the battlefield in eastern #Ukraine where the most fierce fighting is occurring and where Russians are making incremental gains."
2022-05-30 21:26:22+00:00,I urge the admin to immediately provide #Ukraine with the multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) Ukraine has requested. This more effective artillery is needed to help #Ukraine defend the eastern portion of its country against Russia's attacks.
2022-05-30 12:09:21+00:00,"On this Memorial Day, we remember the brave men and women who have laid down their lives to defend our country. Join me in honoring the sacrifices of those who paid the ultimate price for our freedom."
2022-05-30 02:35:37+00:00,The admin must not deter itself from providing this assistance for fear of provoking Russia. The MLRS can help balance the field in Ukraine's favor and should be approved and shipped immediately.
2022-05-30 02:35:36+00:00,The admin must immediately provide Ukraine with the multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) Ukraine has requested. This defensive weaponry will help Ukraine defend the eastern portion of its country against Russia's advances.
2022-05-29 23:38:57+00:00,"I also met with Moldova’s Minister of Internal Affairs Ana Revenco. We discussed the significant challenges that Moldova has faced on its border with Ukraine, and how extremely generous the Moldovan people have been welcoming Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion. https://t.co/69F2UVPiau"
2022-05-29 22:41:08+00:00,"I also had the opportunity to meet with Natalia Gavrilita, Moldova’s Prime Minister to discuss the security and humanitarian situation in eastern Europe and thank them for their assistance in this effort. https://t.co/eSwYLxCfjk"
2022-05-29 20:18:15+00:00,"Today while at the joint Ukraine-Moldova border crossing at Palanca, I proudly walked into Ukraine.

2022-05-29 15:07:43+00:00,"Specifically, we should provide the MLRS mobile rocket launchers the Ukrainians are requesting. These are defensive weapons needed to protect Ukraine. Our allies and the US must continue to give #Ukraine the tools it needs to defend itself from the brutal Russian attacks."
2022-05-29 15:07:42+00:00,"Based on my briefings and discussions this weekend in Germany and Eastern Europe, including with senior Ukrainian officials, I believe the administration should immediately provide artillery to Ukraine that can more effectively counter the Russian weapons."

2022-05-28 18:09:23+00:00,"Pleased to meet with Prime Minister Ciuca, Economy Minister Sparatu, State Secretary Fota, members of parliament, and representatives of the Ukraine refugee response in Romania on Saturday. We had the opp to discus the security and humanitarian situation in Eastern Europe."
2022-05-28 13:55:57+00:00,U.S. military leadership in Europe is working with over 40 allied countries to provide military assistance to enable Ukraine to defend itself. I had very helpful briefings from our military this weekend and appreciated the chance to thank US troops stationed there.
2022-05-28 01:50:01+00:00,"After my briefings today, it is clear that, although the Ukrainians are fighting bravely in the east, they are outgunned by the Russians. These MLRS systems can help balance the field in Ukraine’s favor. https://t.co/VQUzGYQKTP"
2022-05-28 01:50:01+00:00,I urge the administration to immediately provide Ukraine with the multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) that Ukraine has requested. This has been one of President Zelenskyy’s top requests from the West for some time and we must provide it urgently.
2022-05-27 22:20:05+00:00,"I also met with U.S. troops stationed at USAG Stuttgart, including many from #Ohio, and thanked them for their commitment to the U.S. and its support for freedom loving countries. https://t.co/N5hNFzDjOK https://t.co/nUjKf6JFC0"

2022-05-26 18:05:59+00:00,These tariffs were imposed after the U.S. found China stealing billions of dollars of intellectual property. We must make clear to China that failing to comply with the Phase One Trade Agreement has consequences. https://t.co/FHeKeF6Ejz
2022-05-26 18:05:59+00:00,"The Biden admin has publicly signaled a desire to lift the tariffs, a policy position long advocated for by the Chinese Communist Party."
2022-05-26 18:05:59+00:00,"Yesterday, I urged President Biden in a bipartisan letter to keep Section 301 tariffs in place, which currently target China and its illegal and unfair trade practices that undermine American #jobs."
2022-05-26 15:34:50+00:00,"Over the next 5 years, the UTC program will fund 35 university consortiums that will explore mobility, safety, and advanced transportation research in order to address critical transportation challenges throughout the U.S."

2022-05-25 22:24:19+00:00,"The Biden admin claims that it has lowered budget deficits. The reality is while the deficit will shrink next year, it will grow exponentially through 2032, when it will be 6.1% of GDP, a figure only seen six times since WW2."
2022-05-25 22:24:19+00:00,"Today’s @USCBO report shows inflation will continue to remain high through 2024. Instead of pursuing more of the same reckless spending, the Biden admin should work with Republicans on common-sense policies that encourage growth w/o inflation."
2022-05-25 21:56:55+00:00,We must do everything possible to stop foreign governments from stealing our research and innovation. https://t.co/Wl5f9kNqs1
2022-05-25 21:56:54+00:00,US innovation continues to be a high-value target for China’s talent recruitment efforts &amp; any conference report w/ significant increased levels of federal funding w/out the protections included in the Safeguarding American Innovation Act would be a huge giveaway to Beijing.
2022-05-25 21:56:54+00:00,"I commend @TheJusticeDept for its work to help protect American innovation &amp; research from theft by foreign govts like #China. This case highlights the need to ensure my Senate-passed, bipartisan Safeguarding American Innovation Act is included in the USICA conference report."
2022-05-25 16:14:37+00:00,I commend the bravery and quick action by on &amp; off duty Border Patrol Agents yesterday in Uvalde. I hope the Agent &amp; all the victims injured recover quickly.

2022-05-25 11:14:10+00:00,The U.S. and our allies must signal unity whether it be in #Ukraine or the Indo-Pacific. Support for freedom-loving countries is critical to the national security of the United States and we must show that America is a beacon of strength for the free world.
2022-05-25 11:14:10+00:00,"In addition, I urged the Biden admin to go further in their efforts to sanction Russia. As President Putin continues to commit egregious war crimes, the U.S. could and should be doing more to cripple the Russian economy."
2022-05-25 11:14:09+00:00,I am looking forward to confirming Finland and Sweden’s request to join the @NATO alliance when that vote comes to the Senate floor and I hope that the Biden admin will move their application forward swiftly.
2022-05-25 11:14:09+00:00,"Yesterday, marked the 13th consecutive session week I discussed the brutal invasion of #Ukraine on the Senate floor. I am encouraged that the Senate came together to pass the supplemental emergency funding for #Ukraine last week."

2022-05-24 18:49:19+00:00,More on the surging drug epidemic in my op-ed for @DispatchAlerts: https://t.co/NYvPNhPAIr
2022-05-24 18:49:18+00:00,"We can start by passing my CARA 3.0, FIGHT Fentanyl Act, and TREATS legislation, which expands our health care and justice system’s scope to ensure that all Americans fighting addiction have the chance to overcome this disease, and those who sell synthetic opioids are punished."
2022-05-24 18:49:18+00:00,"Congress must double down the effort to address the risks of fentanyl being masked as prescription drugs and ensure those with addiction have access to the help they need. Together we can make our streets, neighborhoods, and communities safer from these synthetic opioids."
2022-05-24 18:49:18+00:00,"The synthetic opioid, fentanyl, is the main culprit, including fentanyl in counterfeit pills. Because of COVID-19, the U.S. drug crisis is being fueled by the use and sale of these counterfeit prescription pills."
2022-05-24 18:49:18+00:00,"According to the latest data from the @CDC, 107,622 drug overdose deaths occurred in the U.S. last year, the largest number ever recorded in a calendar year. In 2020, #Ohio reported more than 5,200 deaths."
2022-05-23 13:48:56+00:00,"@CBP stats show fentanyl seizures at the border increased 48% in April 2022 compared w/ April 2021 &amp; increased more than 420% compared with April 2020. This admin must take action to control our southern border, as both fentanyl seizures and illegal entries hit record levels."

2022-05-22 22:55:36+00:00,Last week I defended the Ohio steel industry during testimony before Intl Trade Commission.
2022-05-22 20:43:01+00:00,"I urge Congress to pass my CARA 3.0, FIGHT Fentanyl Act, and TREATS legislation to ensure that those struggling with addiction have the resources they need."
2022-05-22 20:43:01+00:00,"#Ohio continues to face rising levels of opioid abuse, overdoses and overdose deaths. The biggest culprit by far is the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl. This year #Ohio will report more than 5,200 overdose deaths."
2022-05-22 18:02:33+00:00,The Biden administration should abandon its plan to appeal this Title 42 ruling and instead focus on working with Republicans and Democrats alike to come up with a sensible plan to fix the crisis everyone acknowledges is unsustainable.
2022-05-22 18:02:32+00:00,"In addition to the continued surge of record number of unlawful migrants, the @CBP stats also show the surge in illicit narcotics continues to rise, with seizures of heroin and fentanyl up more than 36% from March. Two sad records: Record drug seizures and record overdose deaths."
2022-05-22 18:02:31+00:00,The April @CBP operational stats showing record numbers of encounters on the southern border demonstrate why lifting title 42 would make a disastrous situation even worse. https://t.co/Dvx0Mj5tBC
2022-05-22 16:29:30+00:00,Glad to see DHS is now backing off this new disinformation body- at least for now. Foreign disinformation is already tackled through the State Department Global Engagement Center.
2022-05-22 16:29:30+00:00,The proposed Dept of Homeland Security Disinformation Governance Board raises deep concerns. That’s why I joined several of my GOP colleagues in sending a letter to Senate Approps Committee urging all funding for the board be prohibited. https://t.co/RjfvLrR26D
2022-05-22 14:56:41+00:00,"With inflation showing no signs of slowing, the Biden admin should lay out a plan to increase supply and provide relief for American families. The administration should work with Republicans on pro-growth policies to improve supply and get our economy moving again."
2022-05-22 14:56:40+00:00,"Inflation has reached a 40 year high, gas prices have risen to record numbers for 12 straight days. This means demand is outstripping supply. The Fed is trying to reduce demand thru interest rate hikes. Best plan is to increase supply, including energy supplies."
2022-05-22 02:56:29+00:00,Best for American working families to increase supply.
2022-05-22 02:56:28+00:00,"Gas prices continue to hit record highs. As the price of gas continues to rise, the Biden admin should expand American energy production to help provide relief for the American people. Energy inflation can be tamed either by reducing demand or increasing supply, or both."
2022-05-21 22:26:00+00:00,The House just passed the bipartisan State and Local Government Cybersecurity Act I wrote to strengthen the relationship between @DHSgov and state &amp; local partners to improve coordination and info sharing to help protect our IT infrastructure at all levels of government.

2022-05-20 23:10:00+00:00,It is time for the administration to fix this problem by following the law and getting control of our southern border to ensure the safety and security of American families. I am ready to work on a bipartisan basis to find long-term solutions.
2022-05-20 23:09:59+00:00,The alternative would have caused the situation at our southern border to go from a crisis to a catastrophe as April @CBP stats demonstrate with a surge not just of unlawful migrants but seizures of heroin and fentanyl.
2022-05-20 23:09:59+00:00,I am pleased that the admin's desire to lift Title 42 was blocked today.
2022-05-20 17:41:18+00:00,The Biden admin should be taking every opportunity to provide relief for American families as the U.S. economy begins contracting and a recession looms. https://t.co/67Y4VMQsuR
2022-05-20 17:41:17+00:00,The @BLS_gov announced that April was the 13th consecutive month of decreased wages. At a time when prices are up – wages are down and Americans are seeing their hours cut.
2022-05-20 13:11:31+00:00,Ukrainians with close ties to the US should not feel that they need to make the dangerous approach at our southern border to make use of the admin’s failed border policies instead of using the Uniting for Ukraine program to temporarily come to the US. https://t.co/Dvx0Mj5tBC
2022-05-20 13:11:31+00:00,"The @CBP stats for April reflect a fourfold increase in Ukrainians seeking asylum at our border. Ukrainians should be welcomed into our country as Russia continues its unjust aggression. It is concerning to me, however, that they are arriving at our southern border."

2022-05-19 18:29:06+00:00,Support for our ally Ukraine is critical to the national security of the United States and our allies around the globe. It sends a message to the world’s rogue dictators that America stands for freedom and with our allies in response to malign threats.
2022-05-19 18:29:06+00:00,"It also includes vital humanitarian aid that will help Ukraine, as well as our allies, address the unprecedented refugee crisis in Europe and stave off a global food crisis caused by Russia’s blockade of Ukraine"
2022-05-19 18:29:06+00:00,This package provides critical assistance for weapons and munitions to bolster the Ukrainian military’s efforts to stop and roll back Russia’s invasion.
2022-05-19 18:29:05+00:00,I applaud Senate passage of this emergency funding request for Ukraine and am grateful it passed both chambers of Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support.
2022-05-19 16:30:09+00:00,It was a pleasure to celebrate 200 years of U.S.-Colombian diplomatic relations with Ambassador Pinzón today.

2022-05-19 13:28:46+00:00,Yesterday I joined 51 colleagues in a letter urging the Biden admin to include Taiwan as a partner in the proposed framework. This would be an invaluable signal of America’s commitment to Taiwan. https://t.co/ClE2aB9rGk
2022-05-19 13:28:46+00:00,"Last month, I visited Taiwan as part of a bipartisan congressional delegation where we discussed the importance of Taiwan being included in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework as we signaled our support for Taiwan and its sovereignty."
2022-05-19 10:51:32+00:00,"As we return the Embassy to Kyiv, it’s vitally important we have an ambassador there working with Ukrainian leaders and representing our American interests."
2022-05-19 10:51:32+00:00,Pleased the Senate last night confirmed Bridget Brink to serve as U.S. ambassador to #Ukraine. She is well qualified for this important role.
2022-05-19 01:36:56+00:00,I have expressed strong opposition to the DHS Disinformation Governance Board and urge that any funding for such a board be prohibited.
2022-05-18 23:45:00+00:00,"Enjoyed addressing the Ohio Space Forum hosted by @NASAglenn virtually today. #Ohio has a rich history of aviation &amp; aerospace achievements, and I’m pleased that our Buckeye space &amp; defense leaders are coming together to ensure #Ohio remains a leader in the future of spaceflight."
2022-05-18 22:30:19+00:00,Great to discuss the importance of supporting and expanding energy production in North America with @DavidAsmanfox today.
2022-05-18 18:36:08+00:00,Great to see that our @StateDept team from @USEmbassyKyiv has reestablished our diplomatic presence in #Ukraine. Thank you to the brave men and women from the @StateDept who represent us abroad.
2022-05-18 18:14:19+00:00,It makes no sense to trade Russian oil for Chinese solar panels.
2022-05-18 18:14:18+00:00,The administration should continue to defend American #jobs and not bend to pressure from the far left who are suggesting we throw our workers under the bus without a fair shake.
2022-05-18 18:14:18+00:00,"Pleased to see the Biden admin and @SecRaimondo investigate allegations of China’s unfair trade practices in the solar industry, which harms U.S. manufacturing."
2022-05-18 17:01:12+00:00,"We must double down on our efforts to spread the word that fentanyl is deadly and help people struggling with addiction get the help they need. My CARA 3.0 legislation aims to expand prevention, treatment, and recovery in communities across the county. We must pass this bill now."
2022-05-18 17:01:12+00:00,Lorain County #Ohio has reported 27 overdose deaths for May already. #Ohio has seen a terrifying rise in fentanyl being mixed with other drugs and even masked as prescription pills.
2022-05-18 13:26:35+00:00,"The April CBP numbers show 234,088 total encounters at the border. If the Biden administration revokes the use of the Title 42 health policy next week, our border crisis will become a catastrophe. https://t.co/Dvx0Mj5tBC"
2022-05-18 13:26:35+00:00,The April @CBP operational stats make it clear that it would be irresponsible for the admin to follow through on its plan to lift Title 42 without putting policies in place to secure the border &amp; deter unlawful migrants &amp; illicit narcotics flooding our communities.
2022-05-18 03:01:52+00:00,There is much more to be done and the U.S. and our allies must not let up in our support for #Ukraine at this critical time. https://t.co/nyeF0LvZMI
2022-05-18 03:01:51+00:00,I also spoke about the importance of voting to approve Finland and Sweden as @NATO members as swiftly as possible. It is imperative to illustrate that freedom-loving countries are not going to stand idly by and be intimidated.
2022-05-18 03:01:51+00:00,The Senate should not adjourn until this supplemental package is passed and on its way to the president’s desk so we can give the Ukrainians the resources they need to win this war.
2022-05-18 03:01:51+00:00,"Tonight, I spoke on the Senate floor for the 12th consecutive session week to discuss the brutal Russian invasion of #Ukraine. I am pleased that the supplemental funding bill ensures a smooth resumption of our diplomatic presence in the capital of Kyiv."
2022-05-17 21:26:13+00:00,My heart goes out to the families of the victims and the entire #Buffalo community.
2022-05-17 21:26:12+00:00,"As we continue to learn more about the horrendous murders in Buffalo, it is clear that this attack was motivated by racism and hate. There is no place for this type of evil bigotry or violence in America, and the shooter should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."
2022-05-17 21:19:12+00:00,Tune into @FoxNews tomorrow at noon ⤵️
2022-05-17 16:47:58+00:00,I was pleased to join @ARTBA yesterday to thank them for their leadership to help make the bipartisan infrastructure law a reality.

2022-05-17 13:08:06+00:00,"Thanks to @SenatorCarper, @RepJohnKatko &amp; @RepJimCosta for joining me in leading this bill. This successful stamp program has raised millions of dollars to fund conservation without any taxpayer money &amp; I’m proud we were able to get it across the finish line."
2022-05-17 13:08:06+00:00,"I’m proud the bicameral, bipartisan Tiger Stamp Act was signed into law yesterday so that we can ensure that every last stamp is sold. We owe it to our future generations to preserve our planet’s rich wildlife &amp; natural resources. https://t.co/Q5mWRwIzhN"
2022-05-16 20:12:08+00:00,The Biden Administration should be taking every opportunity to support responsible energy development of our oil and gas resources and provide relief to Americans.
2022-05-16 20:12:08+00:00,"Today @AAAnews recorded the highest average gas prices ever in the United States: a staggering $4.48 per gallon, a near 50% increase since last year."
2022-05-16 01:17:15+00:00,"I urge the Biden admin to work with Republicans to bring back pro-growth economic policies that were creating #jobs, higher wages, and economic prosperity for families &amp; businesses while inflation remained low."
2022-05-16 01:17:14+00:00,Inflation numbers continue to show a troubling trend. The April Producer Price Index remained in the double-digits at a staggering 11%. American families and businesses are hurting and they need relief now.
2022-05-15 22:11:51+00:00,"This legislation includes more prevention messaging and expands our health care and justice systems to ensure that all Americans fighting addiction have the chance to overcome this disease. Together, we can ensure all Americans have access to the care they need."
2022-05-15 22:11:50+00:00,"Congress should further address this epidemic by passing my CARA 3.0, FIGHT Fentanyl Act, and TREATS legislation."
2022-05-15 22:11:50+00:00,"According to the @OHdeptofhealth in 1999, there were 327 overdose deaths in #Ohio. In 2021, #Ohio is set to report more than 5,200 deaths. The synthetic opioid, fentanyl, is the main culprit, including fentanyl in counterfeit pills."
2022-05-15 18:18:33+00:00,"#China has been stealing our military research, health care research, IP &amp; tech for two decades. It’s time to stop them. That’s why my Safeguarding American Innovation Act is a vital component of any competitiveness bill."
2022-05-15 18:18:33+00:00,"Last week I urged the Conference Committee tasked with reconciling #USICA &amp; America COMPETES Act, to include the bipartisan Safeguarding American Innovation Act I wrote with @SenatorCarper to protect taxpayer-funded IP &amp; research from global competitors like #China."
2022-05-15 11:50:28+00:00,"We must not let up in our support for #Ukraine. At a critical time on the battlefield, the Senate must act immediately this week to approve funding for military, economic and humanitarian aid to help Ukraine defeat this brutal invasion."
2022-05-14 22:42:46+00:00,You can find a list of all the names that were added to the wall this year here: roll-call-2022.indd (https://t.co/fL4dEOM4OG)
2022-05-14 22:42:45+00:00,"This #PoliceWeek, the @NLEOMF added the names of 619 officers killed in the line of duty in 2022 to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. I stand with the men and women in blue during a time of rising violent crime and record drug overdoses."
2022-05-14 16:54:12+00:00,We must do everything we can to protect houses of worship and other religious community sites from increasing threats &amp; I’m proud to have led the effort in Congress to both authorize the NSGP &amp; increase its funding. https://t.co/SmnRnb6WDx
2022-05-14 16:54:12+00:00,They need to meet the needs of at-risk organizations this fiscal year to ensure religious and community based organizations have the resources and tools needed to protect themselves.
2022-05-14 16:54:11+00:00,I’ve sent a letter to the Senate Appropriation Committee requesting that the Nonprofit Security Grant Program be appropriately funded.
2022-05-14 11:50:30+00:00,"This delay would impact energy prices &amp; hurt jobs. But also conservation, &amp; deferred maintenance funding for our public lands, that come from energy royalties. It also makes it harder to pursue the important policy of substituting U.S. energy for Russian oil and gas in Europe."
2022-05-14 11:50:30+00:00,"A recent report has indicated that if the next 5-year offshore leasing program isn’t in place by July, an average of $5 billion U.S. GDP could be in jeopardy."
2022-05-14 11:50:29+00:00,"As part of this Administration’s efforts to discourage domestic energy production, they are dragging their feet in releasing a new offshore leasing program."
2022-05-13 21:29:39+00:00,This funding opportunity includes the Nonprofit Security Grant Program that nonprofits across OH can access to upgrade their security to protect against targeted attacks.
2022-05-13 21:29:39+00:00,Cincinnati will also be part of FEMA’s FY22 Urban Areas Security Initiative allowing the city to access funds set aside for high-risk urban areas. https://t.co/ONSWxH3OLQ
2022-05-13 21:29:38+00:00,"Today, FEMA announced FY22 funding opportunities for its Homeland Security Grant Programs that help keep #Ohio and other states safe from terror. https://t.co/ONSWxH3OLQ"
2022-05-13 19:26:37+00:00,Happy 513 Day Cincinnati! How are you celebrating in the Queen City today? #513Day
2022-05-13 18:39:50+00:00,"Ever wonder what factors impact gas prices in Ohio? 
Check out this video from @OOGEEP to learn more about what sets the price at the pump."
2022-05-13 15:54:06+00:00,Great news that Finland is seeking NATO membership. Putin’s quest to divide @NATO and intimidate Europe has failed. I fully support Finland’s desire to join NATO and will support the treaty amendment in the Senate.
2022-05-13 13:11:04+00:00,I found it encouraging that our witnesses believe the federal govt should address security challenges facing #FedRAMP to identify &amp; prevent foreign interference through reforms to the legislation under consideration that will codify the current program.https://t.co/3I8gbE1frR
2022-05-13 13:11:03+00:00,That’s why I co-wrote two bipartisan laws to ensure Buy America rules are applied to all taxpayer-funded infrastructure &amp; public works projects &amp; ensure federal agencies prioritize the purchase of American-made goods in compliance with existing law. https://t.co/exdBlKh2Ik
2022-05-13 13:11:03+00:00,"We must incentivize American-made products to create #jobs in #Ohio &amp; across the US, and as I highlighted this morning at a #HSGAC hearing, that includes improving the federal procurement system further and making the government a smarter buyer on behalf of the American people."
2022-05-13 00:40:12+00:00,https://t.co/DyMgq17A55
2022-05-13 00:40:12+00:00,"Today, at the first meeting of the Conference Cmte reconciling the differences b/w the Senate #USICA &amp; House America COMPETES Act, I stressed the need to include my bipartisan Safeguarding American Innovation Act to guard US innovation against threats from competitors like China."
2022-05-12 22:47:42+00:00,"Joined @TeamCavuto today to discuss how I questioned @SecMayorkas at a #HSGAC hearing last week on the dramatic decrease of deportations of unlawful migrants during the Biden admin, which is 80% less than during the Obama admin. https://t.co/9XSHn96eVr"
2022-05-12 21:59:03+00:00,This administration must take responsibility for its actions and begin to take tangible steps to address inflation and lower energy costs for Americans. Expanding energy production here at home is essential.
2022-05-12 21:59:03+00:00,"This week, the average price of gas hit an all-time high as the Biden admin continues to stifle domestic energy production by canceling oil and gas leases in Alaska and The Gulf of Mexico."
2022-05-12 19:18:47+00:00,We must redouble our efforts to address the risks of fentanyl being masked as prescription drugs and ensure those with addiction have access to the help they need.
2022-05-12 19:18:46+00:00,"Through my bipartisan CARA 3.0 legislation, I’m also working to help state and local government and nonprofit groups strengthen our approach to prevention, treatment, and recovery. This includes expanding access to medication-assisted treatment."
2022-05-12 19:18:46+00:00,My bipartisan FIGHT Fentanyl Act is an opportunity to permanently schedule illicitly manufactured and deadly fentanyl. The country needs a robust response that addresses this emergency and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this legislation.
2022-05-12 19:18:46+00:00,"Last month, the @DEAHQ warned of a nationwide spike in fentanyl-related mass overdoses, which expanded on an earlier warning about fake prescription pills containing fentanyl. It’s the first time in more than six years this type of alert was delivered."
2022-05-12 19:18:46+00:00,"In #Ohio, we have seen a terrifying rise in the use of counterfeit prescription pills being sold. These fake pills often contain deadly fentanyl and are contributing to this crisis."
2022-05-12 19:18:45+00:00,"Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we now have a surging epidemic of drug use and addiction in #Ohio and across the United States that has fueled a record number of overdose deaths and threatens to get even worse if we don’t act."
2022-05-12 19:18:45+00:00,"The @CDCgov report on drug overdose deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic produced grim numbers this week. There were more than 100,000 overdose deaths in 2021, rising nearly 15%."
2022-05-12 18:32:28+00:00,https://t.co/VM05W5DKWY
2022-05-12 18:32:27+00:00,I introduced the bipartisan Migratory Birds of the Americas Conservation Enhancements Act. This legislation would reauthorize and enhance the NMBCA program through @USFWS to support the conservation of more than 380 species of migratory birds.
2022-05-11 21:21:10+00:00,"In addition, wages are not keeping up with the price hikes so Americans continue to essentially take a pay cut. Democrats need to work with Republicans to put pro-growth economic policies in place to address this crisis."
2022-05-11 21:21:09+00:00,"As the U.S. endures the worst inflation in decades, Democrats’ reckless spending policies have contributed to record high gas prices as well as higher food and housing costs."
2022-05-11 21:21:09+00:00,"Today’s inflation report brought more troubling news: April’s numbers were higher than expected, with the consumer price index up 8.3%."
2022-05-11 17:40:41+00:00,Pleased the admin is deploying the Permitting Council created by the FAST-41 law I authored &amp; made permanent by my bill in the bipartisan infrastructure law.  Efficient permitting is crucial to creating #jobs in infrastructure projects in #Ohio &amp; across the US.
2022-05-11 13:18:33+00:00,Yesterday I introduced a bipartisan bill w/ @SenatorSinema to provide @FEMA w/ authority &amp; funding to ensure the most vulnerable communities in #Ohio &amp; across the US have access to preparedness &amp; training needed to keep families safe from technical hazards.https://t.co/026bUOW3wK
2022-05-11 00:58:00+00:00,I was pleased to meet with @KingAbdullahII today.

https://t.co/jrFPodgAUu"
2022-05-10 23:07:48+00:00,"Today, I introduced bipartisan, bicameral legislation to increase private donations to support our National Parks. The National Park Foundation Reauthorization Act of 2022 reauthorizes funding for the National Park Foundation and increases the authorization level to $15 million."
2022-05-10 16:43:19+00:00,"American consumers deserve common-sense, pro-growth economic policies, not the reckless spending spree that the Democrats want to continue. American families are suffering, and they deserve a plan that will provide relief, not more inflation."
2022-05-10 16:43:18+00:00,"The national average price for gas soared to an all-time high today. As we face a worsening energy &amp; inflation crisis, the Biden admin should abandon its reckless spending policies &amp; support responsible efforts to expand domestic energy production."
2022-05-10 16:43:18+00:00,The Biden admin &amp; its policies are responsible for the soaring inflation we see today. Inflation has risen every single month since @POTUS took office. The admin’s reckless spending policies combined with increased regulation have caused the worst inflation in 40 years.
2022-05-10 14:04:25+00:00,I led a bipartisan group of 16 senators urging the Commerce Department to treat Russia like China when they trade unfairly. This news today is good progress. See the letter here: https://t.co/F9BDhzr0aq
2022-05-10 14:04:25+00:00,"Appreciate @CommerceGov for heeding my letter calling for Russia to be reclassified as a non-market economy. Moscow already admits to running 70% of the economy but after its invasion of #Ukraine, the currency controls &amp; seizures of assets only reinforce the need to get tougher."
2022-05-10 03:45:10+00:00,https://t.co/oaNTBepmbm
2022-05-10 03:45:09+00:00,By expanding the United States’ domestic energy production and building the infrastructure needed for U.S. energy products to reach global markets we can help cut off funding for Russia’s war machine altogether.
2022-05-10 03:45:09+00:00,The United States has the resources it needs to help our allies transition away from their reliance on Russia- but we could be doing much more.
2022-05-10 03:45:09+00:00,"Yesterday, our European allies celebrated VE Day, the 77th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s surrender in World War II, by pledging to ban Russian oil. That’s a positive step but the pledge must be turned into action."
2022-05-10 03:45:08+00:00,This evening I spoke on the Senate floor for the 11th consecutive session week to discuss Russia’s ongoing illegal war on #Ukraine.
2022-05-09 22:09:17+00:00,"This week is National #PoliceWeek. Join me in honoring those who put their lives on the line every day to keep our communities safe. As violent crime surges, it is more important than ever to show those serving on the #ThinBlueLine our support."
2022-05-09 19:30:32+00:00,So proud of all of our friends for this effort and the many others ongoing. We stand with #Ukraine!
2022-05-09 00:48:11+00:00,"Unlawful migration and illicit deadly drugs are surging into our communities at historic highs. We owe it to the American people to put in place policies that actually deal with this crisis, instead of making it easier to cross into the United States unlawfully."
2022-05-09 00:48:10+00:00,"This includes processing people as an example, on buses heading toward the interior of the U.S. rather than doing it at the border because the facilities would be overwhelmed. This plan will only add to the pull factor that draws migrants to make the treacherous journey north."
2022-05-09 00:48:10+00:00,"The admin’s response to the increase in unlawful migrants coming to the southern border with lifting the public health authority Title 42 is to make it easier to get people into the interior of the U.S., not to put deterrents but rather to facilitate the flow to make it easier."
2022-05-08 21:53:10+00:00,Ohio State is a leader on not only the national but global stage and it has been an honor to work with such a great university on a variety of issues throughout my time in public service. https://t.co/6Xdb0xsSsj
2022-05-08 21:53:09+00:00,Deeply honored to accept an Honorary Degree in Public Service from THE Ohio State University! @OhioState  @PresKMJohnson
2022-05-08 20:27:47+00:00,"If we don’t get this crisis at our southern border under control by putting in policies that will deter unlawful migration &amp; the surge of deadly drugs, then we are doing a disservice to American communities &amp; law enforcement who work to protect our nation every single day."
2022-05-08 20:27:46+00:00,"Instead, as we heard from the hearing, the current admin’s plan primarily provides more resources to move people through the system and to do so more quickly and efficiently, in effect, to make it more efficient for people to get from the border to the interior of the country."
2022-05-08 20:27:46+00:00,"There is also no plan to put in place policies from the previous admin that deterred migrants including closing the gaps in the wall and completing the technology, Remain in Mexico, Third Country and increased attention to questionable asylum seekers."
2022-05-08 20:27:45+00:00,"As we heard from DHS @SecMayorkas at a hearing this week, there is no plan to fix an asylum system everyone knows is broken."
2022-05-08 20:27:45+00:00,"Along with unprecedented levels of unlawful migrants crossing our southern border, deadly drugs including the synthetic opioid fentanyl are surging across the border based on admin data."
2022-05-08 20:27:44+00:00,The admin is not putting any policy in place to deter the roughly 1 million people a year who are now coming to the border unlawfully and being turned away by Title 42.
2022-05-08 20:27:44+00:00,The Border Patrol has told me they believe they will lose operational control of the border once Title 42 is lifted.

2022-05-07 20:58:48+00:00,"I would urge the administration to instead work with Republicans to put in place pro-growth solutions that encourage more job creation, higher productivity and wage gains for working families."
2022-05-07 20:58:47+00:00,"They have pumped up demand via stimulus spending and curtailed supply by stifling energy production, adding regulations and supporting higher taxes."
2022-05-07 20:58:46+00:00,"This month, labor productivity plummeted 7.5% in the first quarter, the largest decline since 1947. This is a concerning sign because economists agree that productivity is the key to econ growth. It shows that the Biden admin’s approach isn’t working."
2022-05-07 13:40:26+00:00,They weren’t going to do it - what a waste. This gives people a chance to buy them if they want to and the proceeds go to protect endangered species.
2022-05-07 13:40:25+00:00,Good news that the Senate passed the Tiger Stamp Act I introduced with @SenatorCarper to require @USPS to sell the ~41M remaining Saving Vanishing Species Stamps left in stock.
2022-05-07 01:54:43+00:00,Pleased to join POTUS in #Ohio today to discuss why we must pass the bipartisan U.S. Innovation and Competition Act in order to expand American manufacturing and keep the U.S. competitive in the global economy. https://t.co/CX5dgfQ9tn

2022-05-06 15:11:00+00:00,"@CBP The American people deserve to know the truth about what is happening at the southern border &amp; the truth is, unless we address the pull factor that draws unlawful migration, this catastrophe will only get worse. https://t.co/vNiPqNLjnk"
2022-05-06 15:10:48+00:00,"@CBP Yesterday, I pressed administration officials on their plan to handle the catastrophic surge of unlawful migrants &amp; illicit narcotics that are destroying communities in #Ohio &amp; across the US once Title 42 is lifted. https://t.co/iK7qbcPOmw"
2022-05-06 15:10:19+00:00,"@CBP Instead of accelerating the screening of unlawful migrants &amp; putting in policies to allow for quicker facilitation of migrants into the US, the admin should put policies in place to deter people coming unlawfully. https://t.co/yUAWDDHWud"
2022-05-06 15:10:00+00:00,".@CBP agents on the southern border have said they will lose control of the border if Title 42 is lifted. During yesterday’s #HSGAC hearing, I once again urged the Biden admin to reverse course on its current plan to lift Title 42."

2022-05-06 12:39:39+00:00,Earlier this week I spoke on the Senate floor about the need for Congress to swiftly pass emergency supplemental funding to help #Ukraine fight back against Russia’s illegal invasion. Our allies in Europe &amp; around the globe are stepping up and we must continue to help as well.
2022-05-05 21:37:40+00:00,"The result was record wage growth for American families, specifically for low-income families and minorities, all while having virtually no inflation. Republicans are ready to work with Democrats and President Biden to bring back these policies – but we need a partner."
2022-05-05 21:37:40+00:00,"Under unified GOP leadership, the U.S. cut taxes for working families, encouraged energy exploration and production, and removed unnecessary burdens on small businesses."
2022-05-05 18:29:09+00:00,I believe we should be seizing the assets of Kremlin supporters and provide the funds from the sale of these assets to meet the needs of #Ukraine. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to act on this bipartisan legislation so that we can give Ukrainians the help they need.
2022-05-05 18:29:09+00:00,"This week on the Senate floor, I spoke about bipartisan legislation called the RELIEF for Ukraine Act to require the @TheJusticeDept to direct any funds resulting from the disposal of seized Russian assets to support Ukrainian refugees and reconstruction."
2022-05-05 14:01:46+00:00,@SecMayorkas I’m also frustrated w the lack of proper screening &amp; vetting for the Afghan evacuees who didn’t work with us or our partners. This admin must do more to protect the safety &amp; security of all Americans. https://t.co/v9K5mY1wAi
2022-05-05 14:01:05+00:00,"@SecMayorkas I was alarmed that, when pressed, @SecMayorkas refused to commit to finishing the wall or establishing policies like enhanced technology along the southern border, reinstating the Remain in Mexico policy, or establishing asylum adjudication at the border. https://t.co/08SXBJ6du7"
2022-05-05 14:00:20+00:00,"As I told @SecMayorkas yesterday during a #HSGAC hearing, the failure of the Biden admin to put in place policies to address this crisis is unacceptable and they must act immediately. https://t.co/GrCba36hHO"
2022-05-05 13:59:34+00:00,A record 1 million people came to the southern border unlawfully last year and were permitted into the US.

2022-05-03 22:37:42+00:00,"Low-income Americans, who were most harmed by the recent pandemic-induced recession, are the ones who are hit hardest by inflation. The Biden admin should reverse course and work with Republicans on pro-growth economic policies that have proven successful."
2022-05-03 22:37:41+00:00,"Despite this, wages are not keeping up with inflation.  The Biden admin’s policies have led to this surging inflation &amp; their support for more reckless spending &amp; tax hikes will make it worse."
2022-05-03 22:37:41+00:00,"Today, the @USDOL announced that U.S. employers reported a record number of job openings in March. There are 1.95 job openings for every unemployed American."

2022-04-24 20:39:04+00:00,"What is most alarming is these @CBP numbers only demonstrate the unlawful migrants &amp; deadly drugs that CBP is able to apprehend, not those who sneak through. We have to get control on this crisis at the southern border."
