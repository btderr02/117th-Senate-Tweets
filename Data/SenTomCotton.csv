2022-03-09 22:54:06+00:00,President Biden has been on the back foot since this war started. He needs to recapture the initiative—starting with transferring Polish MiGs to Ukraine.

2022-03-08 02:30:15+00:00,"But the level of immigration—legal and illegal—has been too high for too long. And too many immigrants come here without needed skills or any means of support. 

They’re admitted instead by the random chance of geographic proximity or family connections."
2022-03-08 02:30:15+00:00,"Many immigrants are our greatest patriots, leaving behind impoverished, dangerous, and unfree countries for this land of hope. America takes great pride in them, their accomplishments, and their attachment to our shared nation."
2022-03-08 02:29:26+00:00,"We must reject the ideology of globalism, which claims that wide-open borders and wide-open markets are the path to prosperity for all. America’s shuttered factories, boarded-up main streets, and derelict drug dens stand as grim monuments that rebuke this theory."
2022-03-08 02:28:47+00:00,"The phrase “America First” gives the vapors to globalists in both parties, partly because of its World War Two-era disrepute, but to the Jacksonian ear, it sounds like simple, obvious common sense. 

If we don’t put America first, who will?"
2022-03-08 02:27:53+00:00,"That starts with a basic truth rejected by Democrats and, unfortunately, too many Republicans: we are a nation with an economy, not an economy with a nation. We are a people with principles, not a set of principles with a people."
2022-03-08 02:27:25+00:00,"We must rebuild an economy that works for all citizens, especially the forgotten men and women left behind by decades of open borders, unfettered trade, and globalization."

2022-03-08 02:25:22+00:00,No piece of legislation did more to harm Republicans' status as the party of public safety than the First Step Act.
2022-03-08 02:24:44+00:00,"They’ve contributed to the worst increase in murder rates on record and the most drug-overdose deaths ever. There’s only one answer to these radicals: Republicans must work to recall, remove, and replace every last Soros prosecutor."
2022-03-08 02:24:43+00:00,"In many Democratic-run cities, prosecutors refuse to prosecute. These “progressive” or “Soros prosecutors” haven’t just abused prosecutorial discretion, they’ve embraced prosecutorial nullification, ruling entire categories of serious crimes out of bounds for prosecution."
2022-03-08 02:23:26+00:00,"Here, too, Democrats have abandoned the American people—especially our most vulnerable citizens."
2022-03-08 02:23:25+00:00,"Along with protecting our liberty and preserving it for our posterity, our founders also understood that protecting our people from violence, crime, and the breakdown of law and order is another chief responsibility for the government."
2022-03-08 02:22:42+00:00,"Republicans are the party of opportunity, achievement, and excellence for all. We’ll keep schools open, involve parents as partners in their kid’s education, teach kids the skills they need, and restore patriotic education."
2022-03-08 02:21:59+00:00,"Republicans must protect America’s kids from left-wing madness. 

As Reagan understood, a nation cannot long survive if its schoolchildren don’t learn basic skills but do learn to hate their country."
2022-03-08 02:20:09+00:00,"We shouldn’t be cowed by a dishonest media that conspires with the Democrats and Big Tech to cancel, censor, and smear normal Americans."
2022-03-08 02:17:06+00:00,"The Democratic Party has abandoned the soul of Jacksonian Democracy, grounded in a deep and simple love of country, community, and American culture. 

They have cast aside those attributes embodied by the likes of Jackson and Washington: duty, honor, loyalty."
2022-03-08 02:15:11+00:00,"For nearly two centuries, Democratic Party faithful celebrated President Jackson, seeing themselves as the party of the common man aligned against the forces of wealth and inherited power. 

Not anymore."
2022-03-08 02:11:29+00:00,"Ronald Reagan understood what every Republican officeholder must remember: we are elected first and foremost to protect the American people, their prosperity, and their freedom."

2022-03-01 19:30:35+00:00,Democrats are too dangerously naive and ideological to defend America.
2022-03-01 19:30:34+00:00,"Democrats are insisting we subtract military support for Ukraine from our own defense spending. This is a non-starter.

2022-02-21 15:01:22+00:00,Meeting with President Biden won’t change Putin’s calculus. Sanctions should be imposed now—before Russia invades Ukraine. https://t.co/PnVVitwWuF
