2022-03-23 22:51:54+00:00,This ⬇️ is why Nord Stream 2 is so dangerous. It would only deepen Europe’s dependence on Russian energy and fund Putin’s war of conquest. U.S. energy can keep us out of such a trap. https://t.co/lZsrUVP7Tp
2022-03-23 20:38:27+00:00,Summertime E15 is rightfully “in the menu of options” to lower gas prices. But it’s not going to do American drivers any good if E15 only stays on the menu and not in gas pumps. It’s time to leverage American agriculture.  #AgWeek 🇺🇸🌽

2022-03-22 18:18:19+00:00,"If reports are accurate, the WH considered having the IRS mail people gas cards – yet another round of stimulus. Dumping money into the economy like that is exactly what got us into this inflation crisis in the first place.

2022-03-16 22:08:15+00:00,Had a good meeting with the South Dakota sheep growers this afternoon. They told me an interesting fact: The U.S. military is the biggest consumer of American wool — using around 20% of the U.S. wool clip to make uniforms for our troops. https://t.co/mIOVvTsRwA
2022-03-16 14:36:37+00:00,America shouldn’t be giving a single penny to Russia to fund Putin’s unjustified war against Ukraine. Sanctions must be devastating to Putin’s cash flow to help end his aggression.

2022-03-14 22:18:16+00:00,Senate Republicans are clear: We will reject any weak deal with Iran that doesn’t stop its nuclear/ballistic missile programs or its support for terrorism. Iran’s weekend missile attack in Iraq should be a wake-up call to the Biden admin. https://t.co/qRuaicDLR8

2022-03-10 22:41:45+00:00,"Exactly. Rising energy prices affect every American, regardless of party. Rs &amp; Ds agree: Ethanol can help. @SenatorDurbin and I led our colleagues in calling on Biden to make use of this bipartisan energy solution to lower gas prices and leverage American agriculture."
2022-03-10 15:13:07+00:00,"New consumer inflation numbers paint a clear and stark picture: prices are skyrocketing, bills are climbing higher, and hardworking Americans are paying the price — literally — for Democrats’ failed policies."
2022-03-10 00:23:59+00:00,"President Biden should take every step possible to curb rising domestic energy costs and displace banned Russian oil imports. A no-cost, immediate step he can take: Permitting the sale of E15 fuel this summer. A win/win to help lower gas prices &amp; support American ag."
2022-03-09 19:24:15+00:00,".@POTUS Biden is AWOL when it comes to prioritizing clean energy solutions like biofuels.

Well, the ruble has tanked, Russia’s economy is isolated, &amp; Putin is a global pariah. A growing number of Russians, even oligarchs, might also have regime change in mind."

2022-03-01 17:33:43+00:00,"Every dollar the world denies Putin by not buying his oil &amp; gas is one less dollar he has to spend attacking Ukraine.
I've said it before, &amp; I'll say it again: Energy independence is a matter of national security. Biden must reverse course &amp; put American energy back in the game."

2022-02-24 14:43:06+00:00,"In proceeding with this senseless attack, Putin has not only violated the sovereignty of more than 44 million Ukrainians, he has sealed the fate of his own people. Russians will come to know Putin as the murderous warmonger who isolated them from the free world."
2022-02-24 14:33:25+00:00,"The free world cannot accept that one nation can simply attack and subjugate another. The U.S. and allies must provide the critical support Ukraine needs to defend itself, and we must impose real costs against its Russian aggressors."

2021-03-03 00:01:17+00:00,"“Indeed, something has gone seriously awry in California when its attorney general spends his time attacking, instead of defending, Americans’ freedom of speech and religious liberty.”
More from me and @SenTomCotton on Biden's unqualified @HHSGov nominee, Xavier Becerra.👇🏻"
2021-03-02 22:15:09+00:00,"In a pandemic, you’d think @POTUS would pick an HHS nominee w/ a public health background, but Xavier Becerra is a lawyer whose most notable health care experience was fighting nuns in court over their federally granted contraceptive mandate exemption.  https://t.co/G7WMTr2azL"
2021-03-02 21:26:22+00:00,"If Democrats want to ram through a massive spending bill to fulfill a slew of liberal wish list items, then they should at least call it what it is, not mislead Americans by calling it a “COVID relief” bill.
You know their motto, though: Never allow a crisis go to waste. https://t.co/MdbcHQaank"
2021-02-26 22:22:40+00:00,"Once again, the NY/DC media shows how out of touch they are with the real world. It took 5 years for me to work my way up to cook. The point is there were jobs available. With a $15 min wage, for small-town businesses in the hard-hit travel industry, there won’t be."
2021-02-26 15:15:39+00:00,"If Dems have shown the American people anything since taking their thin majority, it’s that they're happy to take advantage of a crisis to force through their agenda w/ no bipartisan support. Spending won’t stop here. This is their 1st major bill. Imagine what’s down the road."
2021-02-26 01:44:34+00:00,"Today I pushed the @USTradeRep nominee to support mandatory country of origin labeling, expand market access, and enforce existing trade agreements.

2021-02-25 23:19:08+00:00,"Biden again asked what to cut from Dems’ giant spending bill. I offered some ideas on Tuesday, but here they are again:
-$350B state/local slush fund
-$86B bailout of multiemployer pensions
-Post-pandemic $$"
2021-02-25 20:37:21+00:00,"Congrats! Good to have you back advocating for producers. Let’s get to work on the priorities we’ve discussed for South Dakota’s farmers &amp; ranchers (resuming CFAP, cattle market integrity, SHIPP, cover crop flexibility, &amp; promoting clean biofuels)."
2021-02-25 19:31:00+00:00,"Iran has repeatedly proven that it can’t be trusted. Biden must stand against Iran’s destabilizing activities/state sponsorship of terror, not grant sanctions relief that funds their malign agenda (&amp; not repeat mistakes of Obama’s terrible nuclear deal).

2021-02-25 00:23:13+00:00,"COVID challenged our nation’s food supply chain &amp; highlighted vulnerabilities. Viable processing facilities are few &amp; far between, making it hard for ranchers to get meat to consumers. I just reintro’d my Strengthening Local Processing Act to help improve access to processing."
2021-02-24 23:13:18+00:00,I started working by bussing tables at the Star Family Restaurant for $1/hour &amp; slowly moved up to cook – the big leagues for a kid like me– to earn $6/hour. Businesses in small towns survive on narrow margins. Mandating a $15 minimum wage would put many of them out of business. https://t.co/izQDOGRAH1
2021-02-24 19:47:02+00:00,"Less than 10% of the $1.9 trillion partisan “COVID relief” bill Democrats are pushing goes directly to combatting #COVID19. Yes, less than TEN percent. 

Makes you wonder where the other 90% of taxpayer dollars will be spent … Can anybody say “liberal wish list”?"
2021-02-24 15:32:52+00:00,Make no mistake – the partisan spending bill that Dems are pushing through Congress is not about helping the American people through this health crisis. 90% of the money they’re spending isn’t directly related to combating COVID. Democrats are using a pandemic for political gain. https://t.co/SO22e5y7HK
2021-02-23 22:30:19+00:00,"A lot of jargon here, but this is a very important step toward getting the power of 5G technology in Americans’ pockets. My MOBILE NOW Act directed the @FCC to work with @NTIAgov to make more spectrum available for 5G for this reason."
2021-02-23 19:39:52+00:00,"The so-called ""COVID relief"" bill (only 10% goes directly to COVID) being pushed through Congress by Dems would raise the minimum wage to $15/hour in all 50 states.

2021-02-19 00:37:37+00:00,Ellsworth has retired its first B-1 bomber as the USAF prepares for the B-21 Raider.

2021-02-04 19:27:38+00:00,"Now is the time for President Biden to live up to his pledge to unify our nation. Not just talk – action. He could start by urging congressional Dems to actually negotiate w/ GOP, instead of trying to force through a leftist agenda. https://t.co/DnoM7vo1wm"

2021-01-27 18:11:04+00:00,I’ve been raising this issue for months.

2021-01-26 21:13:51+00:00,Sens. Sinema &amp; Manchin are standing by principle. Minority protections (which Dems used for years under a GOP majority) are a vital part of the Senate.
