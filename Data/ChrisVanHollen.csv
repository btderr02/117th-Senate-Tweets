2021-01-08 14:35:27+00:00,"Because D.C. doesn’t fully control its own National Guard and police forces, @MayorBowser was required by law to ask Trump for help controlling the violent mob that he himself instigated. We must immediately pass our bill to fix this, then pass #DCStatehoodNow."

2021-01-07 04:29:48+00:00,One image at the Capitol captured the essence of the mob attack on our democracy: a rioter replacing an American flag with a Trump flag.
