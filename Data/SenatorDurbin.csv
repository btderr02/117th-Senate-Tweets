2022-03-24 16:18:57+00:00,This is high praise from someone who knows a thing or two about the law and our nation’s federal courts. The Honorable Ann Claire Williams is a trailblazer in her own respect—so it means that much more to hear her speak this way about Judge Jackson.
2022-03-24 01:57:31+00:00,"What impressed me most about Judge Jackson wasn't just her experience, sterling record, or poise—it was her ability to let all of those show and shine no matter what was being thrown at her. She will make a fantastic Supreme Court Justice."
2022-03-23 23:21:03+00:00,"I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again—there are 100 Senators, but there is only 1 @SenBooker. Make sure you take the time to hear what he had to say to Judge Jackson in @JudiciaryDems today."
2022-03-23 19:19:49+00:00,"Today, we lost a true public servant. A refugee herself, Secretary Albright was a glass ceiling breaker, a champion for democracy and human rights, and a true model of what it means to be an American diplomat. May her legacy serve as a guiding light to future generations."
2022-03-23 02:57:59+00:00,"At the end of the day, Judge Jackson, the President alone chose you. He has put his faith in you to deliver justice on the highest court in the land. I share that faith."
2022-03-22 18:03:21+00:00,There is exactly one living Senator who has effectively changed the size of the Supreme Court—and that was Republican Leader Senator McConnell when he blocked President Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland.

2022-03-21 17:25:39+00:00,"Judge Jackson has ruled for and against Presidents of both political parties. For and against prosecutors and defendants. For and against workers and employers.

She will not be a rubber-stamp for this President, or any President."
2022-03-21 15:59:13+00:00,"Today is an historic day for the United States of America. In its more than 230 years, the Supreme Court has had 115 Justices. Not a single one has been a Black woman. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson will be the first."

It’s time we finally build a world—and legal system—that puts survivors first."
2022-03-16 14:46:19+00:00,"President Zelensky’s speech to Congress today was powerful. Putin has unleashed a savage war of death and destruction on a peaceful, sovereign nation. The U.S. must continue to provide Ukraine with the military and humanitarian supplies it needs to fight back and save lives."
2022-03-15 21:09:29+00:00,"Glad to see @POTUS sign the omnibus spending package today. In addition to key aid for Ukraine, it includes more than $200 million for projects in Illinois—infrastructure, health care, environmental conservation, community violence initiatives, and more."
2022-03-15 18:20:18+00:00,"Our nation is built on some fundamental ideas—like fairness. But millions of women across the U.S. are still doing the same job as men and being paid less for their work.

2021-01-20 14:39:40+00:00,"Fitting that Donald Trump’s last act as President involves pardons for his corrupt cronies, even as he granted clemency far less than his predecessor. The Trump Presidency will be remembered as one of lies, grift, and abuse of the rule of law. Good riddance."
