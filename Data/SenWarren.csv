2021-03-11 19:22:50+00:00,"Our mass transit systems are critical infrastructure for our cities and towns, but COVID has created budget nightmares. Massachusetts will receive over $1 billion in relief for our mass transit systems for operating expenses, payroll costs, and protective equipment."
2021-03-11 19:22:49+00:00,"Restaurants have been crushed all year, and this bill has some real support. The $25 billion Restaurant Revitalization Fund helps small restaurant owners in Massachusetts and nationwide. And it expands the PPP program by $7.25 billion with more flexibility and forgiveness."
2021-03-11 19:22:49+00:00,"With millions of people still out of work during this crisis, cash-strapped families have struggled to keep a roof over their heads. Massachusetts will receive $362 million in emergency rental assistance to help stop a wave of evictions."
2021-03-11 19:22:49+00:00,"To help our schools safely reopen, the relief bill includes $1.8 billion in Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funding for Massachusetts. And for our older students, it has $825 million for MA colleges, including millions to help students with financial aid grants."
2021-03-11 19:22:49+00:00,"We need child care for parents to go back to work – and I fought for $50 billion in child care funding nationwide. Massachusetts is going to see $512 million to support child care providers and help families afford care, and $13.6 million for Head Start."
2021-03-11 19:22:48+00:00,Our state and local governments had to pick up the tab when Trump didn't come up with a federal plan to fight this pandemic. The relief bill has $8.1 billion for Massachusetts state and local government funding with much more flexibility than the CARES Act.
2021-03-11 19:22:48+00:00,The #AmericanRescueAct is a historic piece of legislation for our country’s recovery from this pandemic and economic crisis. But I want to take a moment to mention some of the big wins we fought for to help families back home in Massachusetts:
2021-03-11 16:40:58+00:00,"Today we remember the family, friends, and neighbors we loved – and we search for a way to settle this loss in our hearts. We need each other more than ever, working together to build tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day, with opportunities for better days ahead."
2021-03-11 16:40:57+00:00,"On this one-year anniversary, I’m optimistic about the future. We have vaccines and a strong relief package on the way. The numbers are looking better. But our hearts still hurt from everything and everyone that this pandemic has stolen from us."
2021-03-11 16:40:57+00:00,"And our essential workers – including grocery store workers, farm workers, warehouse workers, meatpacking workers, restaurant workers, and delivery workers – have risked their health in the scariest conditions to keep us safe and fed. We’re in their debt."
2021-03-11 16:40:57+00:00,"Our doctors, nurses, hospital staff, public health experts and scientists have worked around the clock, one grueling day after another, to stop the virus. They’ve carried the weight of the world on their shoulders – our hopes and our heartbreak. They deserve our thanks every day."
2021-03-11 16:40:57+00:00,"When the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic one year ago today, our country didn’t know what was around the corner. Over half a million lives lost. Tens of millions sick. Jobs gone and businesses shuttered. Unthinkable grief without hugs for comfort."
2021-03-11 14:55:14+00:00,"Like so many other families across the country, I lost my brother Don Reed to COVID-19 last spring. Last night I spoke to @NicolleDWallace about how he’s still alive in my heart. https://t.co/BWRFzzp6wY"

2021-03-10 23:49:35+00:00,"Our student loan system is broken. Income-based repayment is supposed to offer relief – but only 32 people's loans have been forgiven by the program. Not 32,000. Just 32. We need to stop blaming student borrowers for this mess and #CancelStudentDebt now.
https://t.co/goH5J58JFp"
2021-03-10 21:19:14+00:00,"This bill creates a grant program to help schools address students’ academic, mental, and physical health needs related to and exacerbated by COVID. We must address the inequities in our public school system &amp; the long-term consequences for students hit hardest by this pandemic."
2021-03-10 21:19:13+00:00,"Our students had significant academic and social-emotional needs even before the pandemic, especially in the most disadvantaged communities. I’m introducing a new bill to tackle these inequities &amp; support students now and throughout their academic careers. https://t.co/RnfIL1KI2Z"
2021-03-10 20:44:18+00:00,Woo-hoo! The historic COVID relief bill on its way to President Biden’s desk will make a powerful difference so our families and our economy can recover from this crisis.

2021-03-09 22:11:24+00:00,"Since the GameStop chaos, I’ve received answers – or non-answers – from Robinhood and Citadel. I’m going to keep fighting for answers – and the SEC could start its investigation by following up on my questions. https://t.co/E4HciF0dbg"
2021-03-09 22:11:03+00:00,Robinhood’s relationship with Citadel gets at the heart of what’s wrong with Wall Street: it’s riddled with conflicts of interest that allow the giants to win every single time. I spoke with @ProfFletcher today about why the SEC needs to investigate the GameStop run up. https://t.co/OlpC58cFI2
2021-03-09 16:03:32+00:00,"Wall Street’s reckless bets that crashed our economy in 2008 hit union pensions like a knife in the ribs.

2021-03-09 02:23:08+00:00,Some naysayers have argued that canceling student debt would saddle borrowers with surprise taxes. @SenatorMenendez and I took care of that in the relief bill by ensuring any student loan forgiveness will be tax-free – so let's #CancelStudentDebt. https://t.co/lo9347LvU7
2021-03-08 20:44:36+00:00,ACICS has rubber-stamped the worst for-profit colleges to suck down taxpayer dollars for useless degrees. I pushed for @usedgov to pull the plug on ACICS in 2016 and again when DeVos reinstated them. I’m glad we’re one step closer to firing ACICS for good. https://t.co/5N1j1r5iyc
2021-03-08 19:25:48+00:00,Tribal nations and Native communities have been hit especially hard by the pandemic. I am very pleased to have joined with my colleagues to pass the federal government’s largest single infusion of dedicated resources into Native communities in US history.
2021-03-08 18:32:41+00:00,"On #InternationalWomensDay and every day, we celebrate the women who fight for a more equitable and inclusive world. We’ve still got a lot of work to do, but I want every little girl to know that they can fight from the heart – and win."
2021-03-08 17:58:19+00:00,Nurses work hard to take care of us when it matters most and I stand with them in this fight. St. Vincent should do the same by remaining at the bargaining table for a fair agreement that provides nurses the help they need to do their jobs safely. https://t.co/jNXKF0d11W

2021-03-06 17:34:05+00:00,"This is just the start of what Congress can do for working families. We must raise the minimum wage to $15/hr. We need to invest in infrastructure, k-12 education, and a clean energy economy. I’ll fight with every tool in the toolbox to help our families and economy recover."
2021-03-06 17:34:05+00:00,I’m happy that my bill with @SenatorMenendez to make any student loan forgiveness tax-free was included in the COVID relief bill. This clears the way for President Biden to #CancelStudentDebt without burdening student borrowers with thousands of dollars in unexpected taxes.
2021-03-06 17:34:05+00:00,I’ve been fighting alongside @SenTinaSmith for a $50 billion child care bailout since April. Great news: the relief bill finally gets us there to help child care providers keep their doors open. Now we need to build a child care system that works for families.
2021-03-06 17:34:05+00:00,"Democrats passed a historic relief package to expand vaccines, safely reopen schools, and help families. It’s a powerful bill that will make a real difference. There’s a lot of good stuff in it but I want to highlight two things:"
2021-03-05 17:30:56+00:00,Students deserve leadership at the @usedgov office of Federal Student Aid who will follow the law and make this program work for student borrowers instead of big corporations. I look forward to working with @SecCardona to reform the FSA. https://t.co/SEmfnSoEeh
2021-03-05 17:30:56+00:00,"Whether it was incompetence, malice, or a mix of both, @usedgov's student loan bank under Betsy DeVos was a disaster. The resignation of her Federal Student Aid COO Gen. Mark Brown is good for student borrowers. https://t.co/7qw2vN5wSN"
2021-03-05 16:42:02+00:00,I just voted to move forward with raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Two-thirds of Americans want to give workers this long-overdue raise to help lift families out of poverty and strengthen our economy. It is time that the Senate reflects the will of the people.
2021-03-05 02:47:02+00:00,I completely agree with my friend @SenTinaSmith: we cannot give Mitch McConnell a veto over the progress that majority of Americans want. It is time to #AbolishTheFilibuster.
2021-03-05 01:13:29+00:00,"Cancelling $50,000 of student debt is the single most effective executive action available to get our economy going and to make progress toward narrowing the racial wealth gap. @SenSchumer and I hope President Biden decides to do this. #CancelStudentDebt"
2021-03-05 01:13:11+00:00,Some people argue that people with student loan debt are just lawyers and doctors with fancy degrees.

We have Trump to thank for making Iran more dangerous.
2021-03-04 17:27:36+00:00,The @DeptofDefense’s record of addressing civilian harm from US military operations is inconsistent and inadequate. @ColinKahl has written persuasively on the need to get this right.
