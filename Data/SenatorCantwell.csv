2022-09-19 16:13:21+00:00,7/ So without the bridge drivers lost their direct route and they had to really jam through the freight traffic of East Marginal Way. Not only did that slow down commuters – it also slowed down our freight &amp; freight capacity.
2022-09-19 16:13:08+00:00,6/ The sudden bridge closure added so much commute time that they were concerned about whether they could keep their jobs in that capacity.
