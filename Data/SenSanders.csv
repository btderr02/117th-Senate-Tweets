2022-12-29 00:52:44+00:00,Southwest's flight delays &amp; cancellations are beyond unacceptable. This is a company that got a $7 billion taxpayer bailout &amp; will be handing out $428 million in dividends to their wealthy shareholders. @USDOT must hold Southwest's CEO accountable for his greed and incompetence.
2022-12-27 21:28:45+00:00,"I support @BCTGM Ingredion workers in their 20th week on strike in Cedar Rapids. If Ingredion can return $250 million this year to shareholders and pay its CEO $10 million last year, it can afford a fair contract that does not increase health costs, decrease wages, or cut jobs."

2022-11-29 21:50:48+00:00,"At a time of record profits in the rail industry, it’s unacceptable that rail workers have ZERO guaranteed paid sick days.

At a time when Exxon, Shell and Chevron increased their profits by 168% to $81 billion in the last 2 quarter by charging outrageously high prices at the pump, we need a windfall profits tax. The revenue should go directly back to the American people."
2022-10-30 23:31:23+00:00,"Today, the people of Brazil have voted for democracy, workers’ rights and environmental sanity. I congratulate Lula on his hard fought victory and look forward to a strong and prosperous relationship between the United States and Brazil."
