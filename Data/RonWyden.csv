2022-03-17 16:46:44+00:00,"Withdrawing from Afghanistan wasn’t easy, but thanks to President Biden's leadership and determination to do so, the US and our NATO allies are able to focus our full attention on supporting Ukraine’s fight for freedom.

2022-03-16 14:00:16+00:00,Very powerful address to Congress this morning by @ZelenskyyUa. Particularly pleased to hear his calls for strong action on American companies helping fund Putin's war. The Russian regime must be held accountable for its indiscriminate murder of children and civilians.
2022-03-15 23:15:47+00:00,It's unconscionable that in 2022 women still must fight to get equal pay for equal work. It's time to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and achieve the goal of #EqualPayDay every day of the year.
2022-03-15 20:27:16+00:00,Glad the Senate has passed the Sunshine Protection Act so Oregonians aren’t springing back &amp; forth each year in a silly exercise that hurts everybody’s health &amp; our economy. Time now for the House to act.

2022-03-15 13:35:13+00:00,Oregonians in every corner of our state are asking their lawmakers “What are you doing to help Ukraine?”  That’s great news for democracy – and a very big problem for Vladimir Putin.

2022-03-12 18:56:48+00:00,A lot of things Putin thought were going to happen aren’t happening. Why? He doesn’t understand the power of freedom.
2022-03-11 16:20:03+00:00,I look forward to working with the administration to pass legislation revoking Russia’s Permanent Normal Trade Relations status.
2022-03-11 16:20:03+00:00,"Vladimir Putin doesn’t get to tear down international order, brutalize the Ukrainian people with his unjust war and then benefit from normal trade relations. President Biden is right to take every possible economic measure to punish Putin’s regime."

2022-03-04 19:56:55+00:00,Prosecuting journalists for speaking truth to power is the true mark of a dictator. My dad was a journalist who fled Nazi Germany and went on to proudly serve his new country in WWII to defeat Hitler. I know firsthand the critical role journalism plays in times of conflict.

2022-03-03 20:49:40+00:00,"This International Sex Workers’ Rights Day, I'm proud to cosponsor legislation to examine how SESTA-FOSTA increased exploitation of and violence against sex workers. Sex workers deserve equal and full labor protection and dignity under the law."
2022-03-03 14:01:49+00:00,"If a service isn’t end-to-end encrypted by default, it isn’t safe. I’m calling on Twitter and Telegram to protect their users globally by encrypting their messaging services as soon as possible."
2022-03-03 14:01:48+00:00,"In September 2018 @Twitter’s then CEO @jack told me the company was working on end-to-end encrypted DMs. Now 3.5 years later, and they're still not encrypted. Telegram has also lulled its users into a false sense of security, failing to encrypt messages by default."
2022-03-03 14:01:48+00:00,"Secure, encrypted communications give people the power to organize and access information that authoritarian regimes don’t want seen. End-to-end encryption is life or death for people living in authoritarian countries like Russia, China, or Saudi Arabia."
2022-03-02 22:57:52+00:00,"As the son of a librarian, my mother instilled in me a lifelong love of reading and appreciation for books. Happy to see these books made it safe and sound from the Library of Congress all the way to @umatillaschools."
2022-03-02 21:36:07+00:00,In 2019 I sounded the alarm on Trump's Interior Department undermining FOIA laws. Now the DOI Inspector General has confirmed my suspicions that these Trump-era policies were designed to whitewash the facts and withhold information from the public. https://t.co/GFSj19Hn63
2022-03-02 16:42:43+00:00,I urge my colleagues to set partisanship aside and quickly revoke Russia’s most-favored-nation trade status to send a clear message to Putin that the invasion of Ukraine will have devastating consequences for his regime. https://t.co/v4sCSc9UmS
2022-03-02 16:42:43+00:00,"This is big: I just introduced legislation to strip Russia of Permanent Normal Trade Relations status, giving President Biden the power to raise tariffs on Russian imports. This will be a huge step to holding Vladimir Putin accountable for his unprovoked assault on Ukraine."
2022-03-02 15:33:43+00:00,"Congress must pass a clean energy package as soon as possible not only to reduce energy costs and carbon emissions, but our reliance on foreign oil and gas as well. Any opposition to doing so is now simply a commitment to relying on tyrants like Putin for decades to come."
2022-03-02 15:33:43+00:00,Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has provided a stark reminder of the need to free ourselves from our dependence on oil and gas from countries ruled by despots like Vladimir Putin.
2022-03-02 03:31:56+00:00,"The work we have ahead isn't easy, but it's never been more important. I commend President Biden for standing with Congressional Democrats in our efforts to create good-paying jobs, tackle the climate crisis, lower health care costs, and much, much more."
2022-03-02 03:31:55+00:00,"President Biden's show of strength against Vladimir Putin stands in stark contrast to Donald Trump's penchant for cozying up to bullies and tyrants. Under his leadership, the U.S. will continue to work with its friends and allies to hold Putin accountable."
2022-03-02 03:31:55+00:00,"What we just heard from @POTUS Biden was a resounding message of strength and unity at a time when our country — and the world — is in need of a leader that can and will do everything in their power to unite, not divide."
2022-03-01 20:34:44+00:00,Protecting the privacy of kids online is absolutely the right move. I support these efforts to ban targeted advertising aimed at kids and pass stronger protections for all Americans' private information.
2022-03-01 20:34:44+00:00,Very pleased that @POTUS Biden is joining bipartisan members of Congress to take action on the mental health crisis. All Americans should be able to get mental health care where &amp; when they need it. I look forward to the work ahead to make that a reality. https://t.co/hu0Ly51aFY
2022-03-01 18:57:11+00:00,"It’s important to remember that the path to Putin’s invasion was paved, in part, by Donald Trump’s blackmail of President Zelensky and a sham Senate ‘investigation.’ Some Republicans are going to try to whitewash this history, but the facts are clear."
2022-03-01 18:57:10+00:00,"As chair of the Senate Finance Committee I’m pushing for every possible economic tool to make Putin pay for his actions. While the Treasury Department has done a remarkable job implementing tough sanctions, there are several key areas where Congress must support tough action."
2022-03-01 18:57:10+00:00,"The key to holding Vladimir Putin accountable for his unprovoked invasion of Ukraine is following the money, and rooting out billions in illicit assets stashed around the world by Putin and his cronies."
2022-03-01 16:55:24+00:00,"Secure, encrypted communications, such as apps like Signal, are essential to fighting authoritarian censorship around the world."
2022-03-01 16:55:23+00:00,Trump's cronies shamefully choked off funding for these critical internet freedom tools. I strongly support @OpenTechFund’s work to give Russians the power to organize and access news that doesn't parrot the party propaganda line.
2022-03-01 16:55:23+00:00,"Vladimir Putin wants to prevent the Russian people from learning the truth about his unjustified invasion of Ukraine. But now, more and more Russians are using internet freedom apps and other tech to safely bypass Putin's censorship."
2022-03-01 00:56:37+00:00,"Tonight the Senate had the opportunity to codify Roe v. Wade into law. The right to a safe and legal abortion has never been in greater jeopardy in America, and I won't stop fighting as hard as I can to protect it. #WHPA"
2022-02-28 19:06:16+00:00,"President Biden has done an outstanding job of uniting the world together against Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. His leadership stands in stark contrast to Donald Trump kowtowing to Putin, blackmailing President Zelensky over political favors, and undermining NATO."
2022-02-28 12:59:54+00:00,The world is showing it is ready and willing to hold Vladimir Putin accountable for his unprovoked assault on Ukraine. As chair of the Senate Finance Committee I will continue to push for every possible economic tool to make Putin pay for his actions.

1. Tax increases for seniors and working families. 
2. Billionaires continue to pay no income taxes. 
3. Further gut IRS funding to allow rampant tax evasion by wealthy Republican donors."

2022-02-23 02:38:55+00:00,"It should come as no surprise Republicans’ big idea is raising taxes on retired seniors and working parents. At the same time, they celebrate the fact that billionaires often pay no income tax for years, or even decades. This is not an agenda the American people support."
2022-02-22 14:39:54+00:00,"Russia must face aggressive sanctions from both the United States and our allies in response to its blatant violation of Ukraine’s territory. Unless Vladimir Putin withdraws Russian troops from Ukraine, he is condemning Russia to exist as an international pariah."
2022-02-21 18:25:53+00:00,"In mourning the death and fervently hoping for the recovery of the shooting victims, let’s always remember that normalizing violence against anyone exercising their First Amendment rights in our country cannot be tolerated."
2022-02-21 18:25:53+00:00,Violence is unacceptable from any quarter. The reckless rhetoric by far-right Republicans that the Jan. 6 insurrection was “legitimate political discourse” is a lie that inflames violence.

2022-02-08 16:44:24+00:00,"When it comes to mental health care, America is failing its young people. It's past time for Congress to get serious about expanding access to mental health care for every young person, and in the coming months, that's exactly what I'm going to be fighting for."
2022-02-08 15:04:58+00:00,"Republicans on the Supreme Court just gutted the remainder of the Voting Rights Act, undoing protections Americans fought and died for. Suspending the filibuster to pass ironclad voting protections has never been more important."

2022-02-07 18:56:13+00:00,"This is big: The IRS has notified my office it plans to transition away from using facial recognition verification, as I requested earlier today. While this transition may take time, the administration recognizes that privacy and security are not mutually exclusive."
2022-02-07 15:54:45+00:00,Americans shouldn’t have to sacrifice their privacy for security. Full stop. Today I’m calling on the IRS to end its plan to require facial recognition for online accounts. https://t.co/cggpAnc7va

2022-02-02 19:40:06+00:00,I've spent my career in the Senate fighting to protect kids and aid victims of abuse. But this bill does nothing to turn around the Justice Department’s tragic failure to prioritize child welfare and abuse cases.
2022-02-02 19:40:05+00:00,"Instead, the EARN IT Act threatens the privacy and security of law-abiding Americans. This bill will make it easier for predators to track and spy on children and also harm the free speech and free expression of vulnerable groups."
2022-02-02 19:40:05+00:00,"This sadly misguided bill will not protect children, stop the spread of vile child exploitation material or target the monsters that produce it."

2021-02-02 17:43:05+00:00,"The Republican ""plan"" is just another blueprint for cruelty: pushing families who are hurting from one economic cliff to another in just three months. This is the time for big, bold action, and that's just what Democrats are going to do. https://t.co/6E5UJQh0Eo"
2021-02-01 21:15:15+00:00,"We can't address our country's racial inequality crisis without ending the outdated, dangerous war on drugs and its disproportionate impact on Black and Brown Americans. @SenSchumer @SenBooker and I are going to introduce legislation to do just that."

2021-02-01 19:25:30+00:00,This proposal is an insult to the millions of workers and families struggling to survive this crisis. A bill that sets up yet another cliff for jobless workers in a few short months is a non-starter.

2021-01-28 21:50:33+00:00,"For the past 4 years, Republican lawmakers have been hellbent on putting a politician in every exam room with a woman and her doctor. Today @POTUS took steps to roll back dangerous policies restricting access to critical care for millions of women. This is real progress."
2021-01-28 21:36:30+00:00,The last thing families should be worried about during a pandemic is how to afford their health care on top of struggling to pay rent and buy groceries. This swift action by @POTUS will move America towards an era where health care is affordable and accessible for all.
2021-01-28 17:50:50+00:00,"There’s a long road to recovery ahead. Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers are still claiming we don’t need to act big with more support for workers and families."

2021-01-15 16:19:11+00:00,"Donald Trump has no regard for the safety of Americans. Whether it’s inciting riots in Washington DC or reigniting the Timber Wars in the Pacific Northwest, which a decision like this clearly will do, his only loyalty is to lining the pockets of corporate America."
2021-01-15 01:34:28+00:00,This plan meets the urgent needs of the American people and is the right thing to do for our country’s long-term economic recovery. I look forward to taking the lead on getting economic triggers across the finish line to get jobless workers off the financial roller coaster.
2021-01-15 00:00:03+00:00,Americans are sick and tired of these headlines. It’s time for Congress to pass my bill to put consumers back in control of their information and hold companies and executives criminally accountable for lying about how they collect and share our most personal data.

2021-01-14 21:42:36+00:00,The Trump administration's only objective was terrorizing migrants and refugees. This is evil in its purest form. Next week our country begins a new chapter to repair the damage at our southern border and restore humanity to our immigration policies.
2021-01-13 23:10:17+00:00,Donald Trump is a clear danger to our country and our democracy. Mitch McConnell must bring the articles of impeachment to the Senate floor as soon as possible for a final verdict. There cannot be unity without accountability.
2021-01-13 19:12:11+00:00,"In one week, Democrats will retake the Senate majority and the first thing on my agenda will be extending the $600/week benefit so workers kept home by this crisis can pay rent and buy groceries."
2021-01-13 15:59:59+00:00,Add to the list of Trump-induced disfunction in government: it is now a badge of honor for a judge to be overturned by the Supreme Court.
2021-01-13 15:59:58+00:00,These judges can’t help themselves from making the conservative fever dream a reality: putting a politician in every exam room between a woman and her doctor. This is repugnant.
2021-01-12 23:51:44+00:00,"Spoke last night with @PeteButtigieg about his plans to create jobs, rebuild America’s infrastructure, and tackle the climate crisis. He will bring fresh ideas to the incoming administration and I look forward to working with him to get them across the finish line."
2021-01-12 17:24:15+00:00,Selfishness has real consequences.

2021-01-11 15:44:00+00:00,Trumpism will endure long after Trump leaves office. The surest way to expel it is through election reform. Democrats have the opportunity to implement real changes to fight voter suppression and ensure every American can fulfill their constitutional duty.

2021-01-09 14:50:40+00:00,"Help for families and jobless workers shouldn’t be tied to the outcome of political games, it should be tied directly to economic recovery. Under my plan, Mitch McConnell won't decide whether you can feed your family."
2021-01-08 22:05:53+00:00,There must be consequences for senators who would foment a violent mob for personal gain. I call on Senators Hawley and Cruz to resign and accept the responsibility which they so clearly bear.
2021-01-08 22:05:53+00:00,The behavior of President Trump and Senators Hawley and Cruz culminating in the assault on the seat of our democracy shocks that conscience. Any Senator exhorting such an assault violates their sworn oath and is unworthy of holding federal office.
2021-01-08 22:05:53+00:00,Every member of the Senate takes a sacred oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. Upholding that oath is a matter of conscience.
2021-01-08 19:14:09+00:00,A lot has happened this week but we cannot lose sight of the crisis millions of Americans continue to face. This week’s victory in Georgia means families and workers will finally get the help they need to survive this crisis.
2021-01-07 17:32:49+00:00,"As I said last night Donald Trump is a clear and present danger to our democracy. His Cabinet must use the 25th amendment to act. And if Mike Pence and Trump’s “see-no-evil” Cabinet don’t have the stomach to do their duty, Congress should re-convene to impeach this dangerous man."
2021-01-07 15:40:36+00:00,"As I return to work today, I’m more grateful than ever for all the U.S Capitol staff who work so hard every day to keep this place running. The threats each of you faced yesterday from domestic terrorists were horrific. That must never happen again."
2021-01-06 23:06:35+00:00,"I thank the Capitol Police for their courage protecting all elected officials from criminals bent on destroying democracy. And I very much look forward to resuming the urgent work for our country, as soon as possible."
2021-01-06 23:06:35+00:00,"As a steadfast defender of the First Amendment, I will always support peaceful protest even if I disagree with the views that are expressed. This is far from peaceful protest."
2021-01-06 23:06:35+00:00,All Americans must be able to elect House and Senate members safe in the knowledge that their views will be represented in civil debate here in Congress without mob rule ever squelching that discussion.
2021-01-06 23:06:35+00:00,Today's riots by insurrectionists in the nation's Capitol caps off four years of Donald Trump fanning the flames of fanaticism. Every Republican lawmaker who supported his efforts to overturn a legitimate election shares responsibility for today's violence.
2021-01-06 21:04:17+00:00,My staff and I are safe and sheltering in place in a secure location. We will continue following the guidance of U.S Capitol Police and recommend others in the area do the same.
2021-01-05 18:42:47+00:00,Spoke this morning with Energy Secretary nominee Jennifer Granholm. She is the right choice to get the Energy Department back on track to reaffirm our nation’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions and getting the best deal for American families.
2021-01-05 16:06:45+00:00,Had a great talk this morning with Katherine Tai about how to ensure that U.S. workers are at the center of trade policy in the Biden-Harris administration.

2021-01-04 18:30:34+00:00,"When Senate Republicans refused to hold Donald Trump accountable for attempting this same stunt last year, I said I feared it would lead to an escalating abuse of power. Unfortunately I keep being proved right, and Senate Republicans are responsible for it."
